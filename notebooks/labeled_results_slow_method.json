The 2003\u201304 season saw an\noffensively boosted Mavericks roster (with the acquisitions of Antoine Walker\nand Antawn Jamison) but a dip in Nash's scoring contributions. As a result, he\nwas not selected for the All-Star and All-NBA team rosters even though he\nachieved new career highs in assists per game (8.8) and free throw accuracy\n(91.6%).[16] In the 2004 playoffs, the fifth-seeded Dallas failed to make\nprogress yet again as the Sacramento Kings saw them off four games to one.[26]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.624094009399414\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\nIn the 2000\u201301 season, Nash averaged 15.6 points and 7.3 assists per game in a\nbreakout season.[16] With Nash directing the team's offense, Nowitzki and\nFinley playing at their best, and the acquisition of All-Star Juwan Howard\ncomplementing the high-scoring trio, the Mavericks earned a playoff berth for\nthe first time in more than a decade. Dallas lost in the Western Conference\nSemifinals four games to one to the San Antonio Spurs, but it marked the\nbeginning of a memorable run for Nash and the Mavericks.[19] In the 2001\u201302\nseason, Nash posted career-highs of 17.9 points and 7.7 assists per game[16]\nand earned a spot in the NBA All-Star Game and on the All-NBA Third\nTeam.[20][21] He was now an All-Star, increasingly appearing in television\ncommercials and, with Finley and Nowitzki, a part of the Dallas Mavericks \"Big\nThree\".[22] Dallas earned another trip to the playoffs but lost again in the\nSemifinals to the Sacramento Kings four games to one.[23]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.8112621307373047\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n### Dallas Mavericks (1998\u20132004)\nIt was in Dallas that Nash established himself as a formidable point guard,\nbeginning a decade as one of the game's top players. During his first year as\na Maverick (the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 season) he started in all 40 games\nhe played in, and averaged 7.9 points, 2.9 rebounds and 5.5 assists per\ngame.[16] The 19\u201331 Mavericks failed to make the 1999 playoffs, but in the\n1999\u20132000 season, the team's prospects improved considerably. Nash missed 25\nmid-season games due to an ankle injury, but came back to record six double-\ndoubles in the last month of play.[12] He finished the season with averages of\n8.6 points and 4.9 assists per game.[16] More importantly for the team,\nsecond-year teammate and friend Dirk Nowitzki was blossoming quickly into a\ntop player, veteran Michael Finley was having an All-Star-calibre year, and\nthe team's new owner, billionaire Mark Cuban, was bringing new energy and\nexcitement to the franchise. Nash now had a supportive environment in which he\ncould thrive.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.9759461879730225\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\nIn his rookie season, Nash only managed 10.5 minutes a game,[16] but in his\nsecond season, his playing time increased significantly and he was even ranked\n13th in the league for three-point field-goal percentage.[8] Nevertheless, the\nCanadian's tenure with the Suns did not last. Nelson had just taken a job as\nassistant general manager of the Dallas Mavericks under his father, Don\nNelson, and convinced him to acquire the under-utilised Nash.[17] Following\nthe 1998 NBA draft, Nash was traded from the Suns to the Mavericks in exchange\nfor Martin M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp, Bubba Wells, the draft rights to Pat Garrity and a first-\nround draft pick (who later turned out to be future Phoenix teammate Shawn\nMarion).[18]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.6985445022583008\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\nNash originally attended Mount Douglas Secondary School in Saanich, British\nColumbia, but after his grades began to drop, his parents decided to enroll\nhim at St. Michaels University School, a private school in Victoria.[11]\nThere, he starred in basketball, soccer, and rugby union. While playing\nbasketball during his senior season, Nash averaged 21.3 points, 11.2 assists,\nand 9.1 rebounds per game.[12] In the 1991\u201392 season, he led his team in his\nfinal year to the British Columbia AAA provincial championship title, and was\nnamed the province's Player of the Year.[13]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.4666612148284912\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n#### 2011\u201312 season\nIn February 2012, Nash was named to his eighth All-Star Game. At the time, he\nwas leading the NBA in assists per game.[49] On 21 April 2012, Nash passed\nOscar Robertson for career assists versus the Denver Nuggets. Despite his\nstellar play the Suns missed the 2012 playoffs for the second consecutive\ntime. He finished the season averaging 12.5 points and 10.7 assists per game\non 53.2% shooting from the field (tying his career high). Near the end of the\n2011\u201312 season, Nash was named the winner of the PBWA's Magic Johnson Award.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.7196767926216125\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n## Player profile\nNash is known for his dribbling, passing, and shooting abilities.\nNash was praised for his playmaking, ball-handling skills and shooting. He led\nthe league in assists for five years, averaging 11.5 assists per game in\n2004\u201305, 10.5 in 2005\u201306, 11.6 in 2006\u201307, 11.0 in 2009\u201310 and 11.4 in\n2010\u201311[16] and won the NBA Skills Challenge in 2005 and 2010.[12] As of the\nend of 2012\u201313 season, he had a 90.4% career free throw shooting average\n(formerly the best in NBA history, as of 2013[update] second to Stephen\nCurry)[107][108] and a 42.8% career three-point shooting average (eighth-best\nin league history),[109] and ranked as one of the top 10 players in league\nhistory in total assists, assists per game, and three-point field goals\nmade.[110][111][112] He is ranked second (starting from 1986\u201387) in regular\nseason point\u2013assist double doubles.[113] In the 2005\u201306 season, Nash became\nthe fourth player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better from the field, 40%\nfrom three-point range (43.9), and 90% from the line, joining Larry Bird,\nReggie Miller, and Mark Price in the 50\u201340\u201390 club.[33][114] Nash would repeat\nthis feat three more times in the 2007\u201308, 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310 campaigns.[16]\nNash (four times), Larry Bird and Kevin Durant (two times each) are the only\nplayers to have accomplished this feat more than once.[115]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.16870170831680298\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n#### 2013\u201314 season\nNash with the Lakers in 2013\nDuring the 2013\u201314 season, Nash continued to suffer nerve problems stemming\nfrom his leg injury the prior season. In November 2013, he was sidelined for\nan estimated minimum of two weeks due to nerve root irritation.[70] Nash\nreturned on 4 February 2014, shooting 3-for-6 for 7 points. On 7 February\n2014, his 40th birthday, he scored a season-high 19 points in a victory over\nthe Philadelphia 76ers.[71] On 13 March, Nash was ruled out for the remainder\nof the season by D'Antoni. He was suffering from a recurrence of nerve\nproblems stemming from an earlier collision to his left leg with Chicago's\nKirk Hinrich, and the Lakers wanted to give Kendall Marshall and Jordan Farmar\nmore playing time. However, Nash returned on 21 March after a groin injury to\nFarmar that was expected to sideline him a minimum of two weeks.[72][73]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.0869329571723938\nSteve Nash | Biography, Coach, & Facts | Britannica\n[MOD6]\nHowever, Nash broke his leg in the second game of the 2012\u201313 season. Although\nhe still managed to play in 50 games, his effectiveness was limited, and his\nplay was merely league-average. Despite the preseason hype, the injury-plagued\nand dysfunctional Lakers were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs\nthat season. Complications from the broken leg limited Nash to just 15 games\nthe following year as Los Angeles struggled through another disappointing\ncampaign. In October 2014 the Lakers announced that Nash would miss the entire\n2014\u201315 season because of recurring nerve damage in his back. He retired from\nprofessional basketball in March 2015 and soon thereafter became a part-time\nconsultant for the Golden State Warriors. Nash was inducted into the Naismith\nMemorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.09250691533088684\nSteve Nash | Biography, Coach, & Facts | Britannica\n[P4]\n[AM4]\n[MOD4]\nThe Suns advanced to the Western Conference finals in 2004\u201305. The team lost\naggressive forward Amar\u2019e Stoudemire to injury in the next preseason and yet,\ndespite the absence of one of the league\u2019s best young players, once again\nappeared in the conference finals in 2005\u201306. Nash himself was even better,\naveraging a personal-best 18.8 points per game. In 2006\u201307, with Stoudemire\nback, the Suns dominated the NBA for much of the season, finishing with the\nsecond best record in the league (61\u201321). However, giving Nash a third\nconsecutive MVP would have put him in the same class as all-time greats Bill\nRussell, Wilt Chamberlain, and Larry Bird. The voters balked. He finished\nsecond in the MVP voting to Nowitzki. The Suns then had a disappointing\npostseason, losing in the conference semifinals.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.13449794054031372\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n#### 2009\u201310 season\nNash in 2009\nNash and the Suns opened the 2009\u201310 season with a series of strong\nperformances, going 8\u20131 in their first nine games (a franchise-best since\n1980\u201381), with Nash producing two 20-assists games.[46] On 21 January 2010,\nNash was named as the starting point guard for the West for the 2010 NBA All-\nStar Game.[47] With him operating at the point, the Suns were the highest-\nscoring team in the league for the fifth season in a row, and were seeded\nthird in the conference for the 2010 playoffs with 54 wins. Behind solid\nperformances by Richardson and veteran Grant Hill, the Suns defeated the\nPortland Trail Blazers 4\u20132 in the first round of the playoffs, and swept the\nSpurs 4\u20130 in the second round. The Suns met the defending champions, Los\nAngeles Lakers, in the conference finals. After losing the first two games,\nPhoenix won the next two to tie the series. A Ron Artest buzzer-beater in Game\n5 pushed the Lakers one game closer to the Finals, and Kobe Bryant's 37 points\nin Game 6 completed the defeat of the Suns.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.19033223390579224\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n#### 2005\u201306 season\nIn the next season, Stoudemire suffered a serious knee injury, and Johnson and\nQuentin Richardson were traded away.[33] The Suns were not expected to repeat\ntheir successful 2005 season, but with Nash directing the same high-tempo\noffence, the team compiled a respectable 54\u201328 record and won the division\ntitle.[30][33] On 2 January 2006, Nash recorded 28 points, 5 rebounds and 22\nassists in a 140\u2013133 triple overtime loss to the New York Knicks.[34] The Suns\nwere again the highest-scoring team in the league with seven players averaging\ndouble figures in points per game,[33] and Nash was voted for the first time\nto start for the 2006 Western All-Star team.[35] In the last game of the\nseason, Nash recorded a triple-double of 16 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists\nin a 106\u201396 road win over the Trail Blazers.[36] Having recorded career highs\nin points (18.8), rebounds (4.2), field goal percentage (.512) and free throw\npercentage (a league-leading .921), and leading the league with 10.5 assists\nper game,[12] Nash was named the league MVP for the second year in a row.[37]\nIn the first round of the 2006 playoffs, Phoenix overcame a 3\u20131 deficit\nagainst the Los Angeles Lakers and won the series 4\u20133.[33] The Los Angeles\nClippers were their Conference semifinals opponents, and the Suns again needed\nseven games to clinch the series.[33] For the second year in a row, however,\nthe Suns bowed out in the conference finals, this time to Nash's former team,\nDallas.[33]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.7391992807388306\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n#### 2007\u201308 season\nNash with Shaquille O'Neal\nNash played in 81 regular season games during the 2007\u201308 season; in this\ncampaign, the Western Conference was especially competitive and he led the\nSuns to 55 wins and the sixth seed for the 2008 playoffs. Although there was a\ndip in his regular season output, Nash's shooting remained sharp; the accuracy\nof his shooting was on par with his 2005\u201306 MVP campaign (shooting at least\n50% from the field, 40% from the three-point arc, and 90% from the free throw\nline).[16] On 31 January 2008, he collected his All-Star stripes for the sixth\ntime in his career.[41] However, Nash continued to experience agony in the\nplayoffs. Despite a mid-season trade that sent Shawn Marion to the Miami Heat\nand brought four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal to the team, the Suns were\ndefeated in the first round of the 2008 playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs for\nthe third time in four years.[42] In the deciding Game 5, Nash was perceived\nto have suffered from \"elimination-game jitters\", and turned over the ball\ntwice in the final two minutes of what was a tight contest.[42] Nevertheless,\nNash was later named to the All-NBA Second Team for the 2007\u201308 season.[43]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.9634009599685669\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\nIn the 1995\u201396 season, Nash began attracting the attention of the national\nmedia and professional scouts. He had spent the previous summer honing his\nskills, playing with the Canadian national team and working out with\nestablished NBA players Jason Kidd and Gary Payton.[8] Santa Clara again\ncaptured the WCC title, and for the second consecutive year, Nash was named\nConference Player of the Year, the first Bronco to repeat since Kurt\nRambis.[12] He scored 28 points in leading the No. 10 seed Broncos to a first-\nround upset win over No. 7 seed Maryland, but then the Broncos were eliminated\nby Kansas. Nash's performances ensured that he earned an honourable mention\nAll-America as a senior by The Associated Press and the USBWA. He also\nfinished his career as Santa Clara's all-time leader in assists (510), free\nthrow percentage (.862), and made and attempted three-pointers (263\u2013656).[12]\nHe remains third on the school's all-time scoring list (1,689) and holds Santa\nClara's single-season free throw percentage record (.894).[12] In September\n2006, Nash's jersey No. 11 was retired, becoming the first Santa Clara\nstudent-athlete to receive that honour.[14]\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",

Well, let's\njust say it's not even the best song on that album.\n\n14\\. \"Million Reasons\"\n\nDitto for this track off 2016's Joanne that similarly peaked at No. 4.\n\n13\\. \"LoveGame\"\n\nPeaking at No. 5 in 2008, the fourth single off debut album The Fame is\nresponsible for introducing \"disco stick\" into the national lexicon. And for\nthat, we salute it.\n\n12\\. \"Judas\"\n\nFun fact: That's The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus starring as the titular\ntraitor in the music video for this track off Born This Way that peaked at No.\n10.\n\n11\\. \"Poker Face\"\n\nNo bluffin' with our muffins, here.

And that's because the power ballad, which peaked at No. 1, is an\nabsolutely stunning composition. When the song opens up and she hits those\nhigh notes?

And we couldn't have been any happier.\n\n9\\. \"Paparazzi\"\n\nIsn't it wild that this track off The Fame, the first of Gaga's to explicitly\nexplore her obsession with fame and notoriety, only peaked at No. 6? And yes,\nthat is True Blood's Alexander Skarsgard in the iconique music video, which\nserved as a prequel to the visual of another track a little higher up on this\nlist.\n\n8\\. \"The Edge of Glory\"\n\nThe euphoria that sets in by the time the late, great Clarence Clemons rips\ninto his sax solo on this Born This Way single that peaked at No. 3 is f--king\npalpable.\n\n7\\. \"Alejandro\"\n\nThere's something so summer-y about this synthpop slapper, which finds Gaga\ndoing a pitch-perfect riff of Ace of Base's signature sound. Our only quibble\nwith the track, which peaked at No. 5 as one of The Fame Monster's singles?\nThe stark, almost brutalist feel of the music video never matched the vibe of\nthe tune for us.\n\n6\\. \"You and I\"\n\nWe got our first taste of the country-rock sound Gaga would explore in full a\nfew years later on Joanne with this Born This Way power ballad that peaked at\nNo. 6 in 2011.

(It was\noriginally written for Britney Spears to include on a greatest hits\ncompilation. She chose \"3\" instead.) Included on The Fame Monster and peaking\nat No. 3, the song is, hands down, one of Gaga's best dance-pop moments.

And that's because nine years ago, in 2011, it's when\nshe delivered unto an adoring public her second studio album, the iconic Born\nThis Way.\n\nThe album, which saw Gaga expand her dance-pop sounds to incorporate a wider\nswath of genres, including rock, disco, house and more, was a massive success,\nselling more than one million copies in its first week. In fact, it had the\nhighest first-week sales for any album in the previous five years. Beginning\nwith its empowering and inclusive title track, the LP spawned four top 10 hits\non the Billboard Hot 100 chart, with \"Born This Way\" going on to become the\n1,000 song to reach No. 1 on the chart since its inception in 1958.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.031651496887207\nLady Gaga's 30 greatest songs \u2013 ranked! | Lady Gaga | The Guardian\n## 25\\.

Poker Face\nAs if to prove her debut single, Just Dance, was no fluke, Gaga and RedOne\nupped the ante with its follow-up. Built around a similarly intoxicating synth\nriff, and an early trait of wordless, repetitive hooks, the global No 1 was\ninspired by Gaga\u2019s efforts to hide the fact she spent her time in bed with an\nex-boyfriend fantasising about women.

Is this title track off the 2011 album,\nwhich ascended all the way to No. 1, a bit reductive of Madonna's \"Express\nYourself\"? Sure, there are similarities.

They had 4 FA Cups (2 post-war) and 2\nLeague Cups. They also won the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup in 1970. To put these\nnumbers into context, they have won the Second Division seven times, a joint\nrecord.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.88905143737793\nHow many trophies have Manchester City won? - AS USA\nAnd that was the extent of the City trophy cabinet.

With only a single FA Cup in\nthe next three decades and attendance slowly dwindling, it was high time for\nchanges. After Joe Mercer was appointed as manager in 1965, the club entered a\nhot streak; during his six years in charge, City won a First Division title,\nboth English Cups and a Cup Winners' Cup. The post-Mercer period saw the club\nwin another League Cup in 1976 before succumbing to another long spell of\nmediocrity.  \n  \nThe return to top football in England started in the season 1998-99. After a\ndramatic play-off match against Gillingham, City succeeded to climb from\nSecond Division to the First Division. The team managed to go directly through\nthe Division One to the Premier. After relegation from Premier League, they\nwould the next season win First Division by ten points ahead of West Bromwich.\nAnd after that, Manchester City has established them self as a Premier League\nteam.  \n  \nFor many years, Maine Road was City's home stadium, but in 2003 City of\nManchester Stadium was built with a much bigger capacity.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.7344560623168945\nHow many trophies have Manchester City won? - AS USA\nM.

He accompanies the others to Vladovin, to rescue Dominic from\nCipher. Admittedly, the deal has been sweetened a bit in that he's allowed to\ndrive a sleek Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago LP640. In what are by far the most daring\nconditions Roman has handled a vehicle in yet, he takes the bright orange\nsports car out onto the ice as he attempts to outrun a moving submarine.\nUnfortunately, it doesn't work out, and he loses yet another car. But he is\nable to take down a decent number of enemies before he's rescued by Tej, and\nthey're able to successfully save Dom and the world once again.\n\nJust when it seems like there's nowhere else for Roman to reluctantly go, an\nold enemy from Dominc's past returns and forces the gang to new heights \u2014\nliterally. In 2021's \"F9,\" Roman and Tej get even more experimental than they\nalready have by attaching jet engines onto a car and taking it into the\natmosphere. One wonders, as the movies continue, how much further Roman's\nstory might go, as the sky is clearly not the limit. Could the troubled young\nkid from Barstow's ultimate destination be outer space? Only time will tell,\nbut if the past proves anything, it's that Roman Pearce is going places.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.365426063537598\nRoman Pearce | Heroes Wiki | Fandom\nAfter discovering that Dom and Cipher are going to New York they follow them\nand Roman uses a 2010 Bentley Continental GT to chase after Dom.

The gang travel to Vladovin and Roman drives a\nLamborghini Murci\u00e9lago LP640 which is destroyed when it becomes trapped in\nbroken ice and sinks into the water. Roman is saved by Tej and tags along with\nHobbs in his car.

First introduced in \"2 Fast 2\nFurious\" as a sort-of replacement for Vin Diesel, Roman has undergone one of\nthe larger character shifts in the now-packed franchise. Viewers have\nwitnessed him go from being a curt tough guy to an overly talkative smoothie.\n\nJust as capable as any other member of the team, Roman brings an element of\ncomedy to the franchise that would otherwise be wall-to-wall strong silent\ntypes. Say what you will about the heroes within Dom's family, but there's not\na ton of charm there to carry a movie forward. That's why Roman, played by\nTyrese Gibson, is around to pull off scenes with fumbling aplomb. It gives the\naudience a few chuckles before they're slammed back to watching Diesel\nsilently pummel big bads.\n\nStill, for all of his failures as the group's resident \"talker,\" there's\nactually a lot more to Roman than meets the eye. Unlike some of the other\ncharacters who return to the franchise in \"Fast Five\" after years away, Roman\nhas a lot of backstory and depth to his character that's worth exploring in\nits entirety. This is Roman Pearce's story, from his origins in Barstow to his\nwide-open future.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.1814467906951904\nRoman Pearce | Heroes Wiki | Fandom\nBrian and Roman work with Tej to lose Bilkins's and Markham's tracking devices\non their Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIIand Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder. During\nthat time, Roman finally takes responsibility for the actions that led to his\narrest and reconciles with Brian, who he longer blames. Brain admitted that\nletting Dominic Toretto go was largely motivated by the guilt he harbored for\nbeing unable to help Roman. With help from Tej, they orchestrate a \"scramble\",\nafter driving into a garage they later have hundreds of race cars coming out,\nhaving switched cars with Tej and Suki while in the garage.\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",

He was above that.\"\n\n## 1962 World Cup: Back-to-back triumphs, even without a hero\n\nPeople were once again eager to see the great Pele in action when the 1962\nWorld Cup began in Chile. However, after suffering an injury in the group\nstage, the 21-year-old would not see action for the rest of the tournament.\n\nThe final was almost without another Brazilian great, after Garrincha was sent\noff in the semi-finals, however a call from Brazil's Prime Minister led to\nFIFA allowing the mesmerising winger to play in the decisive match.\n\nIn the final against Czechoslovakia, Brazil found themselves 1-0 down after a\ngoal from Josef Masopust in the 15th minute, before drawing level just two\nminutes later through Amarildo.\n\nIt took until the 69th minute for the deadlock to be broken as Zito struck\nhome to give Brazil the lead. The match eventually ended 3-1 to Brazil, with\nthe last goal scored by Vava in the 78th minute.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.0486395359039307\nHow many times have Brazil won the World Cup? Selecao history and ...\nPele would open the scoring in the final at Estadio Azteca, and he would get\nthree more from teammates to rout Italy 4-1 and win the nation's third World\nCup.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.0070555210113525\nBrazil at the FIFA World Cup - Wikipedia\nBrazil won their first world cup final in 1958, 28 years after the first\ncompetition was held in 1930. The second longest streak before winning their\nfourth world cup title in 1994 came 24 years after winning their third title\nin 1970.

I mean Both songs 'Stairway To Heaven' and 'Ameican Pie' were happened\nto released almost the same time in the end of 1971. If you are interested in\nthe idea of the writing of the song 'American Pie', please look into it on\nthis blog, Songfacts.  \n  \nAt first, I thought the song writer of the song 'Stairway', Robert Plant,\nheard the song 'American Pie' in 1971 and he wrote the song 'Stairway' but\nboth songs were released almost the same period of time in late 1971. That\nmeans it was impossible to write and record and release it in late 1971. then\nI think that they happened to get the same idea of the writing of the lyrics\nof the song. But what still puzzled me was that there were some key words on\nthe lyrics of the songs on that album released by Led Zeppelin in 1971. For\nexample, the word 'Book of love' on the song 'Rock n Roll', or the last song\nof the album 'When levee Breaks'. Because there were same words on the song\n'American Pie', too.

One of those iconic pieces is Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d\nwhich is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its premier live performance\ntomorrow, March 5. Although the studio album that contains the track\n(technically untitled, but commonly referred to as Led Zeppelin IV) was not\nreleased until November 1971, the song was performed at nearly every\nsubsequent Led Zeppelin show after March 5, 1971, turning it into a fan\nfavorite. It was one of the most requested and played songs on American rock\nradio stations in the 1970s. The song came back into the spotlight in 2014\nwhen Led Zeppelin were sued for copyright infringement by the band Spirit, who\nclaimed that \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d was copied from their instrumental track\n\u201cTaurus.\u201d In late 2020, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, meaning\nthat Led Zeppelin had won the court battle.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.2049174308776855\nStairway to Heaven | Rock Music Wiki | Fandom\n## Writing and recording[edit][]\nThe recording of \"Stairway to Heaven\" commenced in December 1970 at Island\nRecords' new Basing Street Studios in London.[8] The song was completed by the\naddition of lyrics by Plant during the sessions for Led Zeppelin IV at Headley\nGrange, Hampshire, in 1971.[9] Page then returned to Island Studios to record\nhis guitar solo.[6]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.1915740966796875\nStairway To Heaven by Led Zeppelin - Songfacts\n* Led Zeppelin started planning \"Stairway\" in early 1970 when they decided to create a new, epic song to replace \"Dazed And Confused\" as the centerpiece of their concerts. Jimmy Page would work on the song in an 8-track studio he had installed in his boathouse, trying out different sections on guitar. By April, he was telling journalists that their new song might be 15-minutes long, and described it as something that would \"build towards a climax\" with John Bonham's drums not coming in for some time. In October 1970, after about 18 months of near constant touring, the song took shape. Page and Plant explained that they started working on it at a 250-year-old Welsh cottage called Bron-yr-Aur, where they wrote the songs for Led Zeppelin III. Page sometimes told a story of the pair sitting by a fire at the cabin as they composed it, a tale that gives the song a mystical origin story, as there could have been spirits at play within those walls.  \n  \nPage told a different story under oath: When he was called to the stand in\n2016 as part of a plagiarism trial over this song, he said that he wrote the\nmusic on his own and first played it for his bandmates at Headley Grange in\nLiphook Road, Headley, Hampshire, where they recorded it using a mobile studio\nowned by The Rolling Stones.

Radio stations received promotional singles which quickly became collector's items.  \n  \nOn Tuesday November 13, 2007, Led Zeppelin's entire back catalogue was made\navailable as legal digital downloads, making all of their tracks eligible for\nthe UK singles chart. As a result, at the end of that week the original\nversion of \"Stairway To Heaven\" arrived in the UK singles charts for the first\ntime. Previously, three covers had charted: the multinational studio band Far\nCorporation reached #8 with their version in 1985, then reggae tribute act\nDread Zeppelin crawled to #62 in 1991 and finally Rolf Harris' reworking\noutdid the other two, peaking at #7 in 1993.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.81836462020874\nStairway to Heaven | Rock Music Wiki | Fandom\n## Live performances[edit][]\nThe inaugural public performance of the song took place at Belfast's Ulster\nHall on 5 March 1971.[14] Bassist John Paul Jones recalls that the crowd was\nunimpressed: \"They were all bored to tears waiting to hear something they\nknew\".[15] However, Page stated about an early performance at the LA Forum,\nbefore the record had even come out,[24] that:\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.737340927124023\nStairway to Heaven | Rock Music Wiki | Fandom\nFootage of the song being played live is preserved on the band's concert film\nThe Song Remains the Same, featuring a performance from Madison Square Garden\nin 1973, and on the Led Zeppelin DVD, featuring a performance fromEarls Court\nArena in 1975.

Based on his own original screenplay and co-\nproduced with Thomas, the film is set amid World War II in 1940 and the\nevacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France. Describing\nthe film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, Nolan wanted to make a\n\"sensory, almost experimental movie\" with minimal dialogue.[140] He said he\nwaited to make Dunkirk until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let\nhim make it as a British film but with an American budget.[141] Before\nfilming, Nolan sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview\nwith Variety, \"knowing and respecting that Chris [Nolan] is one of the world's\nmost imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as\nI did on Ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to\nauthentically acquit this historical drama\".[142] Starring an ensemble\ncast,[143] Dunkirk was released to widespread critical acclaim and strong box\noffice results.[144][145][146] It grossed over $526 million worldwide, making\nit the highest-grossing World War II film of all time.[147] In his review,\nMick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \"It's one of the best war\nfilms ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it\nhas on viewers. There are movies\u2014they are rare\u2014that lift you out of your\npresent circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you\nwatch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. Dunkirk is that kind of movie.\"[148] The\nfilm received many accolades, including Nolan's first Oscar nomination for\nBest Director.[149]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.812717437744141\nChristopher Nolan | Writer, Producer, Director\nGuy Pearce\n, the film brought Nolan numerous honors, including Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay.

Goyer\nto develop a story that he felt would end the trilogy on a high note.[103] The\nfilm was released to positive reviews.[104] Kenneth Turan found the film\n\"potent, persuasive and hypnotic\" and \"more than an exceptional superhero\nmovie, it is masterful filmmaking by any standard\".[105] Christy Lemire of\nHuffPost wrote in her review that Nolan concluded his trilogy in a \"typically\nspectacular, ambitious fashion\", but disliked the \"overloaded\" story and\nexcessive grimness.[106] The Dark Knight Rises was a box office success,\nbecoming the thirteenth film to gross $1 billion.[107] During a midnight\nshowing of the film in Aurora, Colorado, a gunman opened fire inside the\ntheatre, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others.[108] Nolan released a\nstatement expressing his condolences for the victims of what he described as a\n\"senseless tragedy\".[109]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.626638412475586\nChristopher Nolan - Wikipedia\n* v\n  * t\n  * e\n\nSt. Louis Gateway Film Critics Association Award for Best Screenplay  \n---  \nScreenplay  \n2004\u20132009|\n\n  * Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor (2004)\n  * Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry (2005)\n  * Peter Morgan (2006)\n  * Diablo Cody (2007)\n  * Peter Morgan (2008)\n  * Scott Neustadter and Michael H.

The first drafts of the script were written by Jonathan Nolan, and it\nwas originally to be directed by Steven Spielberg.[116] Based on the\nscientific theories of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, the film follows a\ngroup of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for\nhumanity.[117] In a 2014 discussion of the film's physics, Nolan expressed his\nadmiration for scientific objectivity, wishing it were applied \"in every\naspect of our civilisation\".[118] Interstellar \u2013 starring Matthew McConaughey,\nAnne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain \u2013 was released to positive reviews and\ngrossed $773 million worldwide.[119][120] Observing its \"visual dazzle,\nthematic ambition\", The New York Times's A. O. Scott wrote that Interstellar\nis a \"sweeping, futuristic adventure driven by grief, dread and regret\".[121]\nDocumentary filmmaker Toni Myers called the film \"a real work of art\" and\npraised it for exploring a story spanning multiple generations.[122]\nInterstellar was particularly praised for its scientific accuracy, which led\nto the publication of two academic papers.[123][124] The American Journal of\nPhysics called for it to be shown in school science lessons.[125][126] At the\n87th Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and received four other\nnominations.[127] Also in 2014, Nolan and Emma Thomas served as executive\nproducers on Transcendence, the directorial debut of his longtime\ncinematographer Wally Pfister.[128]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.550269603729248\nChristopher Nolan - Wikipedia\nNolan attended University College London and used its Flaxman Gallery for a\nscene in Inception (2010).[4]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.479377269744873\nChristopher Nolan - Wikipedia\n* v\n  * t\n  * e\n\nSt. Louis Gateway Film Critics Association Award for Best Director  \n---  \n  \n  * Alexander Payne / Martin Scorsese (2004)\n  * Ang Lee (2005)\n  * Martin Scorsese (2006)\n  * Joel Coen and Ethan Coen (2007)\n  * Danny Boyle (2008)\n  * Kathryn Bigelow (2009)\n  * David Fincher (2010)\n  * Michel Hazanavicius (2011)\n  * Ben Affleck (2012)\n  * Steve McQueen (2013)\n  * Alejandro G.

At 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the\n1960 Summer Olympics and turned professional later that year. He converted to\nIslam after 1961. He won the world heavyweight championship, defeating Sonny\nListon in a major upset on February 25, 1964, at age 22. During that year, he\ndenounced his birth name as a \"slave name\" and formally changed his name to\nMuhammad Ali. In 1966, Ali refused to be drafted into the military, owing to\nhis religious beliefs and ethical opposition to the Vietnam War, and was found\nguilty of draft evasion and stripped of his boxing titles. He stayed out of\nprison while appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, where his conviction\nwas overturned in 1971. He did not fight for nearly four years and lost a\nperiod of peak performance as an athlete. Ali's actions as a conscientious\nobjector to the Vietnam War made him an icon for the larger counterculture of\nthe 1960s generation, and he was a very high-profile figure of racial pride\nfor African Americans during the civil rights movement and throughout his\ncareer. As a Muslim, Ali was initially affiliated with Elijah Muhammad's\nNation of Islam (NOI). He later disavowed the NOI, adhering to Sunni Islam.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.962435245513916\nMuhammad Ali - Wikipedia\nAli was a resident of Cherry Hill, New Jersey in suburban Philadelphia in the\nearly 1970s.[147] At age 32 in 1974, Ali began an extramarital relationship\nwith 16-year-old Wanda Bolton (who subsequently changed her name to Aaisha\nAli) with whom he fathered another daughter, Khaliah (born June 1974).

According to Khaliah, Aaisha and her\nmother lived at Ali's Deer Lake training camp alongside Belinda and her\nchildren.[148] In January 1985, Aaisha sued Ali for unpaid palimony. The case\nwas settled when Ali agreed to set up a $200,000 trust fund for Khaliah.[149]\nIn 2001 Khaliah was quoted as saying she believed her father viewed her as \"a\nmistake\".[148] He had another daughter, Miya (born 1972), from an extramarital\nrelationship with Patricia Harvell.[150]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.6123147010803223\nMuhammad Ali: Biography, Heavyweight Boxer, Activist\nAli died on June 3, 2016, in Scottsdale, Arizona, after being hospitalized for\nwhat was reportedly a respiratory issue.

At the age of eighteen he competed in the 1960\nOlympic games held in Rome, Italy, winning the gold medal in the\nlightheavyweight division. This led to a contract with a group of millionaires\ncalled the Louisville Sponsors Group. It was the biggest contract ever signed\nby a professional boxer. Ali worked his way through a series of professional\nvictories, using a style that combined speed with great punching power.

It's a\nstandard part of stock research investors use to:\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.2108092308044434\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: What PE Ratio Is And How to Use It - ...\nThe S&P 500 has a long-term average PE ratio of about 16. Higher S&P 500 PE\nratios may indicate that the index is overvalued, while lower ratios may\nindicate that the index is undervalued. For example, the ratio spiked in the\nlate 2000s \u2014 the lead-up to the Great Recession \u2014 and fell to a below-average\nvalue in the early 2010s, as the post-Great Recession bull market began.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.086294174194336\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: What PE Ratio Is And How to Use It - ...\nFor example, if a company has earnings of $10 billion and has 2 billion shares\noutstanding, its EPS is $5. If its stock price is currently $120, its PE ratio\nwould be 120 divided by 5, which comes out to 24. One way to put it is that\nthe stock is trading 24 times higher than the company\u2019s earnings, or 24x.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.0709798336029053\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: What PE Ratio Is And How to Use It - ...\n### Shiller PE ratio\nOne variant of the index PE ratio is the Shiller PE ratio, also known as the\ncyclically adjusted PE (CAPE) ratio. This measure was invented by Yale\neconomist Robert Shiller and involves dividing the price of a stock index,\nlike the S&P 500, by its average inflation-adjusted earnings over the last 10\nyears.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.005861759185791\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: What PE Ratio Is And How to Use It - ...\nAnother way to understand PE ratio: It\u2019s a measure of how much investors are\npaying for every $1 of a company\u2019s earnings. Imagine two similar companies in\nthe same sector. One has a share price of $100 and a PE ratio of 15. The other\nhas a share price of $50 and a PE ratio of 30. The first company\u2019s share price\nmay be higher, but a PE ratio of 15 means you\u2019re only paying $15 for every $1\nof the company\u2019s earnings. Investors in the company with a PE ratio of 30 are\npaying $30 for $1 of earnings.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.893674373626709\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: What PE Ratio Is And How to Use It - ...\nThe long-term average of the S&P 500 Shiller PE ratio is about 17. As with the\nregular PE ratio, there are some cases in which higher-than-average values\nhave predicted future downturns, and in which lower-than-average values have\npredicted future upturns. But studies of the predictive power of the Shiller\nPE ratio have yielded mixed results.[0]\n\nNational Library of Medicine.

He wants to expand that. He's\nproposing these ideological tests where he says that anybody coming into the\ncountry - they will test to see whether they're communists, whether they are\nbigots and people who dislike the United States - that he will bar those\npeople as well.

And, you know, he's somebody who\nhas been very skeptical of trade deals - you know, somebody who pulled out of\nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership. And so it's an area, you know, where he learned\nduring his first term that the president has a lot of, you know, ability to\npush through things without, you know, needing the help of Congress.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.560482978820801\nWhat are Trump's policy goals for a second term? : NPR\nCOLVIN: Well, there's been a long-standing tradition in this country of the\nJustice Department being thought of as independent from the White House, from\nthe president. You know, it's quite, you know, stunning to hear, you know, a\npolitical candidate talking about using that power to target their political\nenemies. But, you know, we saw during Trump's first term the extent to which\nhe really thought of the federal government as sort of his - he implied that\nthe lawyers who worked in the White House counsel's office and the Justice\nDepartment as sort of being his lawyers, and they're to serve him.

He says that he will push Congress to enact a bill establishing that\nthere are only two genders recognized by the U.S. government. And it's not\njust transgender issues that he's been talking about. He's also been talking\nabout crime, you know, sending the federal - you know, National Guard into\ncities like Chicago that he deems out of control, talking about a federal\ntakeover of Washington, D.C., because of crime and because when he drives\nthrough, he sees graffiti that he doesn't like.

And he's gone as\nfar as to say that he intends to appoint a special prosecutor to go after\nBiden, to go after his family. He could even - and he intends, even - to go\nafter potential opponents if somebody is doing well, he says - if somebody is\npotentially beating him, even though he couldn't run for another term.

When announcing the album\u2019s release date, Grande also unveiled its cover, which is the same one she used for \u201cyes, and?\u201d It features a blurry close-up of Grande with red lipstick on. However, Grande also revealed that there would be seven different cover variations. \u201cAlbum cover 5 of 7 tomorrow \u2661,\u201d she posted on her Instagram Story on January 26.On February 7, Grande released the sixth album cover, which is now available for preorder.How many songs are on Eternal Sunshine?There will be 13 songs on Grande\u2019s seventh studio album. According to her website, track 1 is titled \u201cintro (end of the world),\u201d track 5 is \u201ceternal sunshine,\u201d and track 9 is \u201cyes, and?\u201dOn February 7, Grande revealed some more song titles on her Instagram. Track 2 is called \u201cbye,\u201d track 6 is \u201csupernatural,\u201d and track 10 is \u201cwe can\u2019t be friends (wait for your love).\u201dOn February 17, she revealed three more: track 3, called \u201cdon\u2019t want to break up again,\u201d track 7, \u201ctrue story,\u201d and track 11, \u201ci wish i hated you.\u201dThere were also more covers, which she announced in the caption were all available to preorder.And finally on February 27, Grande shared the titles of the last four songs: track 4 is called \u201cSaturn Returns Interlude,\u201d track 8 is \u201cthe boy is mine,\u201d track 12 is \u201cimperfect for you,\u201d and track 13 is \u201cordinary things (feat. nonna).\u201dShe also appeared to hide some song lyrics in the post. They include: \u201cI\u2019ll hold your hurt in a box here beside me,\u201d \u201cIf the sun refused to shine, baby, would I still be your lover,\u201d \u201cHow I just can\u2019t go where you don\u2019t go,\u201d \u201cDeep breaths, tight chest, life, death, rewind,\u201d and \u201cHow could we know we\u2019d make the bad stuff delightful?\u201dWhat can we expect from Eternal Sunshine?On February 1, Grande posted an Instagram Reel from when she first played some of the songs from the album for her family and team.\u201cI wanted to share with you this, it\u2019s kinda a concept album because it\u2019s all different heightened pieces of the same story, of the same experience,\u201d she said in the video. \u201cSome are really vulnerable. Some of them are, like, playing the part that people kind of expect me to be sometimes and having fun with that,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd the rest of it is also just kinda really vulnerable.\u201dWill Grande be putting out any music videos for Eternal Sunshine?On January 12, the same day as the single\u2019s release, Grande put out a music video for \u201cyes, and?\u201dThen, on Friday, March 1, exactly one week before Eternal Sunshine, Grande posted an Instagram Reel announcing what appears to be a music video for her upcoming song \u201cwe can\u2019t be friends (wait for your love).\u201dIt is inspired by the 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, which we can assume the album as a whole takes inspiration from. The movie is about a couple, Joel and Clementine, who break up and decide to undergo medical treatments to permanently erase each other from their memories. In the clip, Grande is sitting in a waiting room reading a consent form that says, \u201cYou have given extensive thought behind your decision and give \u2018Brighter Days Inc.\u2019 the exclusive permission to remove this person completely from your memory.\u201d She looks unsure, and her pen lingers over the \u201cNo\u201d check box for a moment before she changes her mind and checks \u201cYes,\u201d signing the name \u201cPeaches\u201d with a heart on the signature line.A nurse then calls her in for her appointment, and the video ends with, \u201c\u2018we can\u2019t be friends anymore\u2019 (coming soon).\u201d\u201c\u22c6\uff61\u02da\u22c6\u0e3a we can\u2019t be friends \u22c6\uff61\u02da\u22c6\u0e3a \u263c,\u201d Grande wrote in the caption. \u201cone week til eternal sunshine.\u201d Grande already previously revealed that she wouldn\u2019t be releasing any more songs from her new album after \u201cyes, and?,\u201d so sadly we\u2019ll have still have to wait until March 8 to hear \u201cwe can\u2019t be friends.\u201d However, it is unclear if Grande will be dropping the music video the same day, or if that\u2019ll come at a later date.Will Grande be going on tour?According to some genius TikTok sleuths, the coding on Grande\u2019s website was updated to eventually include a \u201ctour dates\u201d section, so we can hopefully expect to see her perform Eternal Sunshine live soon. But, we don\u2019t suggest getting your hopes up just yet. Grande made a very rare podcast appearance on the Zach Sang Show on February 26, her first interview in quite a while, where she admitted that she\u2019s unsure if she\u2019ll go on tour.\u201cI think I would love to do shows. I love being on stage. I miss being on stage. I miss my fans so much, that\u2019s honest to god truth,\u201d she started. \u201cUm, I had a really hard time emotionally on my last tour, but I think that\u2019s because of where I was at. So, just like with music, I think I\u2019m really excited to redefine my relationship to shows when I\u2019m ready and to see what that looks like.\u201d\u201cI do have a very busy year with this and with Wicked,\u201d Grande added. \u201cAnd then the next year I also have Wicked Part Two.

The story centers\non a dysfunctional family traveling cross-country in a VW bus on their way to\nthe Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, where their youngest daughter\n(Supporting Actress contender Abigail Breslin) is a contestant. Carell plays\nFrank Ginsberg, a gay Proust scholar living with his sister (Toni Collette)\nfollowing a suicide attempt. Though Arkin won all the accolades for playing\nthe feisty, drug-snorting grandpa, Carell deserved to be nominated right\nalongside him for his tender, nuanced performance (he was a runner-up at the\nNew York Film Critics Circle). After victories at the PGA and SAG, the film\nlooked like a major contender for Best Picture, but it ultimately lost to\nMartin Scorsese\u2018s \u201cThe Departed.\u201d\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.5199291706085205\nSteve Carell Movies: 15 Greatest Films Ranked Worst to Best - ...\n* ## 7\\.

Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt headline the large\nensemble as various big money players. At times hilarious and enraging, \u201cThe\nBig Short\u201d is a brash, scathing, and enteraining recreation of an American\ntragedy. Carell received a Golden Globe nomination as Best Musical/Comedy\nActor for his performance, while the film reaped Oscar nominations for Best\nPicture, Best Director (McKay), Best Supporting Actor (Bale), and Best Film\nEditing, winning for McKay and Charles Randolph\u2019s adapted screenplay.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.8346338272094727\nSteve Carell Movies: 15 Greatest Films Ranked Worst to Best - ...\n* ## 10\\.

Then, working with the multimedia artist Sean\nRaspet, she created a batch of abstract, unnamable scents with far-out\ningredients (for instance: cricket exoskeletons) to guide the musicians as\nthey recorded each track. Physical copies of the album come with a scratch-\nand-sniff sheet, allowing you to immerse yourself in the same aura that\nsurrounded the band as it played.

It was a bit of a surprise win for the\nmovie. Ex Machina was nominated for two awards tonight, including Best\nOriginal Screenplay (which it lost to Spotlight). As a relatively under-the-\nradar film, it easily could have been overshadowed here by bigger names like,\nyou know, Star Wars. It also won over Mad Max: Fury Road, The Martian, and The\nRevenant.\n\nThe team behind Ex Machina's VFX \u2014 Andrew Whitehurst, Paul Norris, Mark\nArdington, and Sara Bennett \u2014 specifically called out Alicia Vikander's\nperformance as Ava in the movie. Vikander's eerie persona and careful\nmovements were certainly crucial in selling the team's effects, which had most\nof her body replaced with metal, wires, and mesh. It's the type of effect that\nyou stare at for an entire movie without being totally aware it's in front of\nyou, but the Academy was apparently cognizant enough of the work behind Ava's\nlook to vote Ex Machina to victory.\n\n* * *\n\nWatch Chris Rock's opening monologue\n\nComments\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## Nvidia reveals Blackwell B200 GPU, the \u2018world\u2019s most powerful chip\u2019 for AI\n\n* * *\n\n  2. ## Lego\u2019s 3,745-piece D&D set comes with its own playable adventure\n\n* * *\n\n  3. ## Ubisoft let me actually speak with its new AI-powered video game NPCs\n\n* * *\n\n  4. ## Indie, rocked\n\n* * *\n\n  5. ## Here\u2019s the Elon Musk interview that got Don Lemon\u2019s show canceled\n\n* * *\n\n## Verge Deals\n\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your\ninbox daily.\n\nEmail (required)Sign up\n\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

The film has an\nApril 24 release date in China, and Deadline reports that if it were to\nperform like Infinity War, it could be looking at an $840 million worldwide\nopening.

Dan Cathy, co-owner of Pinewood Studios in Atlanta, where some of\nthe movie\u2019s production took place, claimed the combined budgets of both films\ntotaled $1 billion, though Marvel chief Kevin Feige later said that was\ninaccurate. Shortly after Infinity War\u2018s release, The Wall Street Journal said\nit carried a budget \u201cclose to $300 million.\u201d In December, Fortune reported\nthat Infinity War cost $400 million and that Endgame is \u201cexpected to have a\nsimilarly sizable budget.\u201d Deadline estimates that, including advertising,\nInfinity War was a $475 million endeavor for Disney.

Marvel Studios\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Avengers: Endgame is one of the biggest films of all\ntime (our box office comparison piece measures how it stacks up to other\nfranchise conclusions). In terms of production, cast, spectacle and story,\nit\u2019s an absolute juggernaut\u2014the culmination of 11 years of storytelling (it\u2019ll\nbe the 22nd movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe).

At the time, there were rumblings that the films were working with a\nbudget of around $400 million but it was never truly confirmed. Well, that was\nuntil now, as Joe Russo revealed during a panel at Sands International Film\nFestival of St. Andrews that Avengers: Infinity War and its sequel Endgame\neach cost $500M to make. As such, they had a total budget of a billion making\nit probably the most expensive productions in Hollywood.\n\n> I don\u2019t know if these numbers have ever been accurately reported but in the\n> case of Avengers: Endgame or Infinity War, each of those movies was $500\n> million plus. So this is an incredible amount of money that is being spent\n> on these films. And you have responsibility, if you have a conscience to in\n> some way deliver a return on that investment for the people that gave you\n> that money. So it is risky to say \u2018Hey we got a crazy idea, here\u2019s how we\n> can subvert expectations but we\u2019re going to take your two most popular\n> characters and we\u2019re going to have them try to kill each other.\u2019\n>\n> Joe Russo\n\nIt definitely paid off, as not only did Endgame become the highest grossing\nfilm for some time before a re-release of Avatar took back the top spot, but\nwe can only imagine how much money they made on home releases, merchandising\nand more. You have to also respect the fact that the company was willing to\nrisk it. They believed in two directors that had their humble TV roots that\nwould end up developing some iconic entries in one of the largest franchises\nof the world.\n\nSource: Deadline via ScreenCrush\n\n### Related\n\n  * Avengers\n  * Avengers: Endgame\n  * Avengers: Infinity war\n  * Marvel Movies\n  * Movie News\n\nTotal\n\n0\n\nShares\n\nTweet 0\n\nShare 0\n\nShare 0\n\nShare 0\n\nShare 0\n\nJoseph Aberl  Author\n\n##### Previous Post\n\n  * News\n\n## \u2018Yellowjackets\u2019 Ella Purnell Cast as Lead in Amazon\u2019s \u2018Fallout\u2019\n\n##### Next Post\n\n  * News\n\n## Michael Giacchino\u2019s \u2018Werewolf by Night\u2019 Disney+ Halloween Special Started\nProduction\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.1855788230895996\nIs \u2018Avengers: Endgame\u2019 the Most Expensive Movie Ever Made?\n.entry-content\n.entry-meta\n#post-##\nFiled Under: Movies, Entertainment, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Pirates of the\nCaribbean, Avengers, Avengers: Endgame, Lucasfilm, Avengers: Infinity War,\nKevin Feige, justice league, Robert Downey Jr, Warner Bros., box office,\nMarvel, The Walt Disney Company\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.608806848526001\nIs \u2018Avengers: Endgame\u2019 the Most Expensive Movie Ever Made?\nSo would that make Endgame the most expensive film of all time (not accounting\nfor inflation)?

As a highly regulated\nindustry making large investments typically at a stable rate of return and\ngenerating a steady income stream, utilities borrow heavily and relatively\ncheaply. High leverage ratios in slow-growth industries with stable income\nrepresent an efficient use of capital. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector tend to have high D/E ratios for similar reasons.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.4128122329711914\nAutodesk Debt to Equity Ratio 2010-2023 | ADSK | MacroTrends\n## We Need Your Support!\n\nBacklinks from other websites are the lifeblood of our site and a primary\nsource of new traffic.\n\nIf you use our chart images on your site or blog, we ask that you provide\nattribution via a \"dofollow\" link back to this page.

It should be painfully obvious that her audience is targeted toward a younger demographic such as the millennial crowd. It is not meant for anyone who voted for Donald Trump or who cannot understand that it's literally a joke. RELAX. Touching on sensitive topics such as religion, politics and rape are going to offend those who take everything personally. Yes, her comedy is a little raunchy but there are few successful comedians who do not follow the same formula.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.042934417724609\nKatherine Ryan: In Trouble (2017) - Katherine Ryan: In Trouble ...\n8/10\n\nOutstanding\n\nmmoneta4 November 2017\n\nI'm 61, and I've seen a lot of stand-up in my life. This was one of the\nfunniest - totally in the top four.  \n  \nI caught it on Netflix tonight, and was surprised I hadn't heard of Katherine\nRyan before. Now I have to go see if she has additional programs. If not, I\nhope Netflix has the good sense to hunt down what's available and put it in\ntheir catalog.\n\n18 out of 23 found this helpful.

I first saw her standing next to\nJimmy Carr on your face or mine, you could see Katherine Ryan was funny in a\nnon offensive way, unlike Jimmy Carr who achieves laughs, by making fun of\nothers on the show . Due to this, I thought her stand up comedy would be very\nfunny and it was. Yes some could find her jokes slightly offensive, but most\nof them are based around her true life experiences, and not just picking\nsomeone out and laughing at them, as such. Obviously her jokes are very mild,\nunlike some comedians she has worked with in the past. Like Frankie Boyle, who\nis funny, but just pushes it too far. Katherine Ryan says things that could\noffend, then does a cheeky sweet girl smile and gets away with it :)\n\n5 out of 8 found this helpful.  Was this review helpful?

Also, in the Rolling Stones 'Section, you credit them with 12 No.1\nAlbums, as you regard the 2010 No.1 of 'Exile On Main St' ' as an added No.1.\nBut, in your List, you regard it as the 1972 Album returning to No.1, and you\ngive them 11 No.1 Albums. Again, we see inconsistency. You do - correctly -\ngive them 46 No.1 Weeks, in the UK Album Chart...\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.010942459106445\nActs with the most Number 1 albums on the Official UK Chart | ...\n]\n[\n#### Bengy\n\n8th December 2019\n\n9\n\nVote score\n\nIn the Artists section of your web site you say The Beatles have 16 no. 1\nalbums as the 50th anniversary Abbey Road with a new track listing went to 1.\nBy the same logic The Beatles should have another number one for the 50th\nanniversary of Sgt. Pepper. So that\u2019s 17 no. 1 albums overall. After all Elvis\ngot another 3 number 1 singles simply by a change of catalogue number. They\nshould have been re-entries instead of NEW entries.

The 2010 Album was not the\nsame as the 1972 original, as it had a 10 Track 'Bonus Disk' with it. However,\nyou still credit The Beatles with 15 UK No.1 Albums, even though the 2017\nEdition of 'Sgt Pepper...' was not the same No.1 Album, as the original\n1967/1968 No.1. The 2017 No.1 should be counted as a different No.1 than the\n1960's original, because its Track List was not exactly the same. So, the 2017\n'Sgt Pepper...' should be regarded as The Beatles 16th UK No.1 Album. Just as\nthe 2019 'Abbey Road' Album should be credited as their 17th UK No.1 Album, if\nthat reaches No.1. The 2019 'Abbey Road', does not have exactly the same Track\nList as the original 1969 version...\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",

Besides the bucket list opportunities, though, you\nmight be wondering why you should bother taking a trip to any of these places.\nWell, for starters, you'll be surrounded by peace and quiet for miles and\nmiles. And just think of the postcard opportunities! But there's also plenty\nto see, do, and enjoy just outside many of these small towns. From scenic\nmountain towns to pretty lakeside villages and, yes, a few quirky destinations\nthrown in for good measure, there's something here for everyone. Still, only\none of these little locales can take the top spot as the absolute teeniest.\nThe 29-person Hawaiian town of Manele isn't quite small enough, nor is the\n10-person, itty-bitty city known as McMullen, Alabama.

Reader\u2019s Digest\n1 / 51\n\nrd.com, 5W Infographics for Reader's Digest\n\n## Small Town, USA\n\nSmall towns have a special place in the collective memory of Americans. They\nremind us of the places we grew up, or the places we wish we had grown up:\nflags waving from lemonade porches, mom-and-pop shops lining Main Street, kids\nriding bikes along tranquil lanes. In our minds, they tend to look a lot like\nthese charming small towns across the country. But when it comes to the true\nsmallest towns in America, those places may only have a few people living\nthere\u2014and might not even seem like a \u201ctown\u201d at all.\n\nBefore we dive in, here\u2019s how we came up with this list. You probably\nparticipated in the 2020 U.S. Census, which is completed every decade. The\nresults aren\u2019t out yet, but yearly estimates are completed annually, so we\nused the official 2019 Census info for each state. It gets even more\ncomplicated, though, when you consider what the definition of a \u201ctown\u201d is in\nthe first place. An incorporated town has legal municipal boundaries, a\ncharter from the state, and local laws and government, but the Census also\nrecognizes areas it calls Census Designated Places, town-like areas that\naren\u2019t incorporated. Even beyond that, the Census says that \u201cnot everyone\nresides in a place,\u201d which seems nonsensical. But the Census notes that some\npeople live \u201coutside of any place, either in small settlements, in the open\ncountryside, or in the densely settled fringe of large cities in areas that\nwere built up, but not identifiable as places.\u201d If that sounds complicated,\nthat\u2019s because it is. So for this list, we\u2019re sticking with incorporated towns\n(with a few exceptions that we\u2019ll get to later).\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got that sorted, it\u2019s time to start exploring these tiny towns\non our virtual road trip.

Raised in the suburbs of\nHouston, Scott (born Jacques Berman Webster II in 1992) first made noise as an\nin-house producer for Kanye West\u2019s G.O.O.D. Music, working on the 2012 label\nshowcase Cruel Summer and 2013\u2019s Yeezus, which arrived mere weeks after he\ndropped his debut mixtape, Owl Pharaoh. He went on to bring his gothic-edged\nsound to Drake, Migos, Madonna, and Rihanna (\u201cBitch Better Have My Money\u201d),\nwhile his own solo albums\u20142015\u2019s Rodeo and 2016\u2019s Birds in the Trap Sing\nMcKnight\u2014playfully drew the commercial center of rap toward the avant-garde.\nTake 2018\u2019s ASTROWORLD, a swirling, almost psychedelic set that not only\nmanaged to pull together Quavo, John Mayer, Tame Impala, and Sheck Wes on the\nsame album, but also had them gel\u2014a testament to Scott\u2019s vision as an artist\nand superlative curator. He would do it again on 2023's Utopia, which brought\nBeyonc\u00e9, Drake, The Weeknd, James Blake, Future, and Dave Chappelle into the\nfold.\n\nHOMETOWN\n\n    Houston, TX, United States of America \nBORN\n\n    April 30, 1991 \nGENRE\n\n    Hip-Hop/Rap\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.8783477544784546\nTravis Scott on Apple Music\n## Appears On\n\n  * AT THE PARTY (feat.

He died in the sinking of the RMS Titanic.[1][2] Originally\ncalled the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) it held its inaugural\nconference at the headquarters of the Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports\nAthl\u00e9tiques (USFSA), in Paris, France on 1 March 1913 which was attended by 12\nnational associations.[3] Three other countries could not attend but had\nrequested to become a member. The 15 founding countries were: Australasia\n(Australia and New Zealand), Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Great\nBritain, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and\nSwitzerland. Canada, Norway, and the United States were also invited but\ndeclined to join.[4][5] Voting rights were divided based on the perceived\nimportance of the individual countries, with Great Britain's Lawn Tennis\nAssociation (LTA) receiving the maximum six votes.[2]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.35804274678230286\nInternational Tennis Federation - Wikipedia\nIn 1939 the ILTF had 59 member nations. Its funds were moved to London,\nEngland during World War II and from that time onward the ITF has been run\nfrom there. It was based at Wimbledon until 1987, when it moved to Barons\nCourt, next door to Queen's Club. It then moved again in 1998 to the Bank of\nEngland Sports Ground, Roehampton, its current base of operations.[1] In 1977\nthe word 'Lawn' was dropped from the name of the organization, in recognition\nof the fact that most tennis events were no longer played on grass.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.2934131920337677\nInternational Tennis Federation - Wikipedia\nOthers|\n\n  * WEKAF (arnis)\n  * AFLC (Australian rules football)\n  * WBGF (backgammon)\n  * ISBHF (ball hockey)\n  * IBA (bodyboarding)\n  * WB (bowls)\n  * IBJJF (Brazilian jiu-jitsu)\n  * IFBA (broomball)\n  * WCF (croquet)\n  * WDBF (dodgeball)\n  * ICFRA (fullbore rifle)\n  * IGAA (Gaelic football and hurling)\n  * IKF (kabaddi)\n  * IKF (kempo)\n  * FISLY (landsailing)\n  * IMMAF (mixed martial arts)\n  * WMRA (mountain running)\n  * ORSI (ocean rowing)\n  * IFP (pickleball)\n  * IQA (quidditch)\n  * IFMAR (radio-controlled racing)\n  * IRF (rogaining)\n  * WSSF (snowshoe running)\n  * ISF (skyrunning)\n  * WSSA (sport stacking)\n  * ITHF (table hockey)\n  * ITPF (tent pegging)\n  * FIT (touch football)\n  * ITRA (trail running)\n  * IAU (ultra running)\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.010627105832099915\nInternational Tennis Federation | international sports organization ...\nnon homepage categories slider, homepage search and slider is in home-page.jsp\nHome Games & Quizzes History & Society Science & Tech Biographies Animals &\nNature Geography & Travel Arts & Culture Money Videos\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.0497860386967659\nInternational Tennis Federation - Wikipedia\n## See also[edit]\n* List of international sport federations\n  * Association of Tennis Professionals\n  * Women's Tennis Association\n  * History of tennis\n  * Grand Prix tennis circuit\n  * Tennis Integrity Unit\n  * International Tennis Integrity Agency\n  * Wightman Cup\n  * ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",

Will Barton had 14 points and Aaron Gordon added 13 points for the Nuggets, who went 4-2 on a six-game homestand.\",\"Isaiah Stewart, Cade Cunningham, Cory Joseph and Trey Lyles each scored 18 points for the Pistons, who have lost four of five. ''Detroit played hard and they gave us a challenge but we pulled it out,'' said Austin Rivers, who finished with 11 points. ''They've got young, talented players. They're trying to improve. You can't just go in there and sleep on a bunch of pros. They're playing loose. They're playing free and they're dangerous. Give them credit.''\",\"After a 3-pointer by Cunningham pulled Detroit to 75-73 with 3:57 remaining in the third quarter, Davon Reed and Facundo Campazzo hit successive 3's to start a 17-3 run that allowed the Nuggets to take a 92-76 lead into the fourth.\",\"Again, the Pistons rallied. Lyles converted successive three-point plays and Detroit pulled to 94-90 midway through the quarter. The game remained tight in the closing minutes and Joseph's jumper with 1:45 left evened the score at 109-all.\",\"Jokic made a pair of free throws with 40.3 seconds left to give the Nuggets a two-point edge. After a Detroit turnover, Jokic was fouled on a drive to the basket with 17.7 seconds remaining and converted two more free throws.\",\"An offensive foul on Joseph resulted in another turnover with 8.8 seconds left and the Pistons fouled Monte Morris, who made both free throws for the final margin. Detroit coach Dwane Casey lamented the late-game turnovers which took the ball out of the Pistons' hands without putting up a shot.\",\"''We've got to value the ball, and right now we're not valuing the ball ,'' he said. ''Those add up. We've got to take every play as if it's the last play of the game. Until we grow up and do that, we're going to be sad a lot this year.''\",\"The Pistons trailed by 10 late in the second quarter but gradually cut into the deficit and tied it at 60-all at the intermission on Cunningham's pullup jumper that beat the halftime buzzer.\",\"DEMARCUS' DEBUT\",\"DeMarcus Cousins, signed to a 10-day contract Friday, made his Nuggets debut, playing 11:49 in relief of Jokic. He had two points and six rebounds. . ''I didn't have the best shooting performance but I made a couple of plays and the ultimate thing is we've got to win,'' said Cousins, who was 1 of 7 from the floor. ''I'm just trying to come out and have an impact any way I can.''\",\"TIP-INS\",\"Pistons: F Kelly Olynyk has been sidelined again, entering the league's health and safety protocols on Saturday. He played impressively in two games last week after returning from a knee injury that had kept him out for two months.\",\"Nuggets: F Jeff Green was held out of the game because of a left quadriceps contusion. .

Debuting\nat number 68 on June 16, 1984, the song peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot\n100 on August 11, staying there for three weeks (Parker Jr.'s only number one\non that chart), and at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart on September 16, staying\nthere for three weeks.

Of\ncourse, the fun song that gifted viewers the phrase \"Who ya gonna call?\" (as\nwell as a star-studded music video) became just as big of a hit as the\nGhostbusters film itself, but that was far from a sure thing in the months\nleading up to the film's release. From the other songs considered to the\namount of time Ray Parker Jr. was given to complete his task, the story behind\nthe Ghostbusters theme is as captivating as the song itself.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 8.663408279418945\nGhostbusters: The Strange True Story Behind The Iconic Theme Song\nNot injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode.\nNot injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode.\n* Home\n  * Movies\n  * Movie Features\n\n# Ghostbusters: The Strange True Story Behind The Iconic Theme Song\n\nBy Owen Danoff\n\nPublished Oct 2, 2021\n\nRay Parker Jr.'s infectious and unforgettable theme for the 1984 film\nGhostbusters is an iconic piece of movie history that almost wasn't.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 8.057880401611328\nGhostbusters: The Strange True Story Behind The Iconic Theme Song\nParker Jr. was ultimately able to write and record his Ghostbusters theme in\ntwo and a half days. Upon completion, he hurriedly sent a cassette tape to\nIvan Reitman, who immediately incorporated it into the film. Though Parker Jr.\nwas originally asked to write less than a minute of music for the film's\nopening library scene, the track was extended to a radio-friendly four\nminutes. Ray Parker Jr.'s efforts were rewarded with a level of success he had\nnever seen. The Ghostbusters theme quickly became a chart-topping smash and\nwas even nominated for Best Original Song at the 57th Academy Awards. Though\nit's likely that a theme-less Ghostbusters still would have led to sequels and\nmaybe even the return of Gozer in Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Ray Parker Jr.'s\nmusical contribution surely helped the film become the undeniable classic it\nis today.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.8669023513793945\nGhostbusters (song) - Wikipedia\nLindsey Buckingham, on his interview disc Words & Music [A Retrospective],\nstated that he was approached to write the Ghostbusters theme based on his\nsuccessful contribution to National Lampoon's Vacation, \"Holiday Road\". He\ndeclined the opportunity as he did not want to be known as a soundtrack\nartist.[citation needed] Glenn Hughes and Pat Thrall also submitted a demo\nthat was ultimately rejected. The Hughes and Thrall version was later\nrewritten and used as the track \"Dance or Die\" for the 1987 film Dragnet.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.176392555236816\nGhostbusters: The Strange True Story Behind The Iconic Theme Song\nGiven that the Ghostbusters theme would come to be used for several future\nprojects (presumably including the never-made original Ghostbusters 3), it's\nremarkable that Ray Parker Jr. only had a few days to create it. When Parker\nJr. got involved, the movie was already in the mixing process, meaning that\nmusic would be the next addition to the project. Though Parker Jr., a longtime\nsession guitarist, wrote the music quickly, he has admitted to struggling with\nthe theme song's lyrics. In the \"Ghostbusters\" episode of Netflix's The Movies\nThat Made Us, Parker Jr. stated that he couldn't find a good way to sing the\nword \"Ghostbusters,\" the inclusion of which was a must for the studio.\nThankfully, when Parker Jr. was shown a cut of the film, he was struck by the\nin-movie Ghostbusters advertisement (which returns in Ghostbusters:\nAfterlife's Force Awakens-esque trailer). This reminded Parker Jr. of\ncommercials for home services like plumbing and extermination, which led him\nto the phrase \"Who ya gonna call?\"\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.964165210723877\nGhostbusters (song) - Wikipedia\n\n\"Ghostbusters\"  \n---  \nOne of European variants of non-US artwork  \nSingle by Ray Parker Jr.  \nfrom the album  Ghostbusters: Original Soundtrack Album  \nB-side| \"Ghostbusters\" (instrumental)  \nReleased| June 8, 1984  \nGenre|\n\n  * Dance-pop[1]\n  * synth-rock[2]\n\n  \nLength|\n\n  * 4:06 (soundtrack version)\n  * 3:46 (edit)\n\n  \nLabel| Arista  \nSongwriter(s)| Ray Parker Jr.  \nProducer(s)| Ray Parker Jr.  \nRay Parker Jr. singles chronology  \n| \"Woman Out of Control\"  \n(1984)  | \"Ghostbusters\"   \n(1984)  | \"Jamie\"   \n(1984)  \n---|---|---  \nAlternative release  \nSide A of the US single\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.835247039794922\nGhostbusters (song) - Wikipedia\n## Background[edit]\nParker was approached by the film's producers to create a theme song, although\nhe only had a few days to do so and the film's title seemed impossible to\ninclude in any lyrics. However, when watching television late at night, Parker\nsaw a cheap commercial for a local service that reminded him that the film had\na similar commercial featured for the fictional business.[3] This inspired him\nto write the song as a pseudo-advertising jingle that the business could have\ncommissioned as a promotion.[citation needed]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.513205051422119\nGhostbusters (song) - Wikipedia\nIn a 2004 article for Premiere magazine, the filmmakers admitted to using the\nsong \"I Want a New Drug\" as temporary background music in many scenes. They\nalso noted that they had offered to hire Huey Lewis and the News to write the\nmain theme but the band had declined. The filmmakers then gave film footage,\nwith Lewis's song in the background, to Parker to aid him in writing the theme\nsong.[12]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.2487006187438965\nGhostbusters (song) - Wikipedia\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n1984 single by Ray Parker Jr.\n.mw-parser-output .hlist dl,.mw-parser-output .hlist ol,.mw-parser-output .hlist ul{margin:0;padding:0}.mw-parser-output .hlist dd,.mw-parser-output .hlist dt,.mw-parser-output .hlist li{margin:0;display:inline}.mw-parser-output .hlist.inline,.mw-parser-output .hlist.inline dl,.mw-parser-output .hlist.inline ol,.mw-parser-output .hlist.inline ul,.mw-parser-output .hlist dl dl,.mw-parser-output .hlist dl ol,.mw-parser-output .hlist dl ul,.mw-parser-output .hlist ol dl,.mw-parser-output .hlist ol ol,.mw-parser-output .hlist ol ul,.mw-parser-output .hlist ul dl,.mw-parser-output .hlist ul ol,.mw-parser-output .hlist ul ul{display:inline}.mw-parser-output .hlist .mw-empty-li{display:none}.mw-parser-output .hlist dt::after{content:\": \"}.mw-parser-output .hlist dd::after,.mw-parser-output .hlist li::after{content:\" \u00b7 \";font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .hlist dd:last-child::after,.mw-parser-output .hlist dt:last-child::after,.mw-parser-output .hlist li:last-child::after{content:none}.mw-parser-output .hlist dd dd:first-child::before,.mw-parser-output .hlist dd dt:first-child::before,.mw-parser-output .hlist dd li:first-child::before,.mw-parser-output .hlist dt dd:first-child::before,.mw-parser-output .hlist dt dt:first-child::before,.mw-parser-output .hlist dt li:first-child::before,.mw-parser-output .hlist li dd:first-child::before,.mw-parser-output .hlist li dt:first-child::before,.mw-parser-output .hlist li li:first-child::before{content:\" (\";font-weight:normal}.mw-parser-output .hlist dd dd:last-child::after,.mw-parser-output .hlist dd dt:last-child::after,.mw-parser-output .hlist dd li:last-child::after,.mw-parser-output .hlist dt dd:last-child::after,.mw-parser-output .hlist dt dt:last-child::after,.mw-parser-output .hlist dt li:last-child::after,.mw-parser-output .hlist li dd:last-child::after,.mw-parser-output .hlist li dt:last-child::after,.mw-parser-output .hlist li li:last-child::after{content:\")\";font-weight:normal}.mw-parser-output .hlist ol{counter-reset:listitem}.mw-parser-output .hlist ol>li{counter-increment:listitem}.mw-parser-output .hlist ol>li::before{content:\" \"counter(listitem)\"\\a0 \"}.mw-parser-output .hlist dd ol>li:first-child::before,.mw-parser-output .hlist dt ol>li:first-child::before,.mw-parser-output .hlist li ol>li:first-child::before{content:\" (\"counter(listitem)\"\\a0 \"}\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.0203118324279785\nGhostbusters (song) - Wikipedia\nThe theme is estimated to have added $20 million to the film's box-office\ngross.[4]\n## Music video[edit]\nParker on \"Ghostbusters\": \"I was the last resort. I really didn't think I\ncould do it.\"[5]\nThe music video for the song was directed by Ivan Reitman, who also directed\nthe Ghostbusters film, and produced by Jeffrey Abelson. It features a young\nwoman played by actress Cindy Harrell[6] who is haunted by a ghost portrayed\nby Parker, roaming a nearly all-black house interior (with vibrant neon\ndesigns outlining the sparse architectural and industrial features) until the\nwoman finally calls the service.[citation needed]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.002049922943115\nGhostbusters: The Strange True Story Behind The Iconic Theme Song\nRelated: Afterlife Hints The Original Ghostbusters Split Up (Why?)\nJust as many aspects of Ghostbusters came down to quick decisions and snap\njudgments, Ray Parker Jr.'s involvement in the film was far from a sure thing.\nAs Aykroyd and co. were scrambling to finish the film and name the ghost in\nthe Ghostbusters logo, Columbia Pictures was rumored to have reached out to\nLindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac fame, thanks to the success he had found\nwriting \"Holiday Road\" for National Lampoon's Vacation the previous year. The\nfilm studio also received over sixty song submissions from other artists, none\nof which were deemed usable (via CBC). Parker Jr. was only tapped to write the\nsong after he had already booked a flight to Los Angeles for a completely\ndifferent project - not to mention that he was, at the time, largely focusing\nhis efforts away from music in order to take care of his ailing parents. He\nended up extending his Los Angeles stay by a few days, which, incidentally,\nwas all the time he would get.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.98045539855957\nGhostbusters Soundtrack | Ghostbusters Wiki | Fandom\n### Side 2[]\n* 6\\.

It's somewhat thin but has enough\nrousing music and interesting bits of history to make it worth a look for\nteens and up. Violence includes gun use (threats, shooting), people getting\nshot, bloody wounds, violent news footage, a scene of a couple arguing (with a\nslap), someone being kicked in the face and stomach, and more. Marley is also\ndiagnosed with cancer. Two young lovers kiss and lie down on a bed, and\nthere's talk about Marley's affairs and his children by women other than his\nwife. Infrequent language includes a use of \"f--k,\" plus exclamations of\n\"Christ\" \"oh God\" and some offensive Rastafarian terms (\"bloodclaat,\" etc.).\nThere's a lot of casual pot smoking (the movie doesn't delve into the topic,\nbut in Rastafarian culture, cannabis is used more for spiritual reasons than\nto get high) and brief images of people drinking beer and champagne.

The music from those involved also didn't feel amazingly\nutilised, I guess they didn't want it to be too jukebox-y.  \n  \nKingsley Ben-Adir does well in the lead role as Bob Marley himself. I'm not a\nMarley superfan or anything close, I basically only know his biggest hits, but\nthe resemblance of Ben-Adir seemed off to me - a thought that was only\nsolidified when the real Marley appears via archive footage at the end.\nPerhaps that's just me, though.  \n  \nLashana Lynch gives a good performance, spearheading the rest of the cast who\nare alright; interesting to see James Norton, Michael Gandolfini too... even\nif I didn't realise it was Gandolfini until the credits. Overall, it does feel\nlike the film only scratches the surface of Marley's life.

Most biopics\u2014and indeed, almost\nall popular music biopics\u2014struggle for importance while stumbling over the\nsame old clich\u00e9s. By contrast, Bob Marley: One Love never seems to have that\nmuch at stake. There's no succumbing to the pitfalls of fame or drugs or\ngroupies. Marley is comfortable in his skin and never tries to be something\nhe's not. When someone calls him a \"superstar,\" he responds, \"I ain't a\nsuperstar ... I'm a ra-sta!\"\n\nIt's fun to see bits of history come alive\u2014The Clash (who would become hugely\ninspired by reggae music) playing in a club, references to Marcus Garvey and\n\"Two Sevens Clash,\" etc.\u2014and even more fun to watch Marley and the Wailers\nmaking music. Scenes of conjuring up the songs \"Exodus\" and \"Jamming\" are\nelectric, and the moment in which Marley composes \"Redemption Song,\" almost as\nif out of the blue, is quite moving. His wife, Rita (Lashana Lynch), asks,\n\"When you write that?\" And he responds, \"All my life.\" As Marley, Ben-Adir has\nan easy command of the screen, and he gets the moves and the voice just right;\nthis Marley is a performer who does his own thing\u2014\"music and message is the\nsame,\" he asserts\u2014with little concern for fame or glory. Bob Marley: One Love\nmanages to capture, if not in detail, at least the essence of the man and the\nlegend.\n\nShow more\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.5605578422546387\nBob Marley: One Love (2024) \u2b50 6.5 | Biography, Drama, Music\n\n### Box office\n\nEdit\n\n  * Gross US & Canada\n\n    * $89,749,044\n\n  * Opening weekend US & Canada\n\n    * $28,659,004\n    * Feb 18, 2024\n\n  * Gross worldwide\n\n    * $160,949,044\n\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.303776741027832\n\u2018Bob Marley: One Love\u2019 Review: Mostly Positive Vibes - The ...\nSupported by\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n# \u2018Bob Marley: One Love\u2019 Review: Mostly Positive Vibes\n\nThis patchy biopic lauds the Marley of dormitory posters, a snapshot of a\nlifestyle hero who is always the coolest guy in the room.\n\n  * Share full article\n\n  *   * \n\nKingsley Ben-Adir in \u201cBob Marley: One Love.\u201dCredit...Chiabella James/Paramount\nPictures\n\nBy Amy Nicholson\n\nPublished Feb. 14, 2024Updated Feb. 17, 2024\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.1982645988464355\nBob Marley: One Love (2024) \u2b50 6.5 | Biography, Drama, Music\n\n## The Best Biopic Transformations\n\n## The Best Biopic Transformations\n\nKingsley Ben-Adir as Bob Marley, and more actors totally transformed for their\nroles.\n\nSee the gallery\n\nPhotos\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.160916328430176\nBob Marley: One Love Movie Review | Common Sense Media\n* ### Positive Role Models\n\na little\n\nMarley is admirable in many ways but flawed in others.

Chris Blackwell, the White founder of Island Records, is featured\nmore prominently than many Black supporting characters, few of whom have much\ndepth. Racist terms (\"blackie,\" \"rasclat,\" \"bloodclaat,\" \"bumbaclot\") are\noccasionally used, mostly among Black characters. Director Reinaldo Marcus\nGreen is Afro-Latino; he also contributed to the screenplay. The only female\ncharacter who appears in more than a few scenes is Marley's wife, Rita\n(Lashana Lynch); she's largely in his shadow, but there's one scene where she\nargues with him and stands up for herself.\n\nDid we miss something on diversity?

Flowers, Zach\nBaylin and Green. Smartly, the writers avoid the standard birth-to-grave\ntemplate to focus on two years in London, where Marley, a pacifist, survived a\nsurge in election-year violence, even when gunmen shot up his house, injuring\nhim and three others. But the film doesn\u2019t have much to say about his time in\nexile. Was Marley feeling betrayed by his country? Was he homesick? How was he\nhandling his ascension to international superstardom?

With proof of work, miners around\nthe world try to solve a complicated mathematical puzzle to be the first one\nto add a block to the blockchain. Ethereum, however, is working on moving to a\ndifferent form of transaction validation known as proof of stake. With proof\nof stake, a person can mine or validate transactions in a block based on how\nmany coins he owns.

This one features a man and woman who fall in love with one another\nbut they refuse to have sex because each one is married. Even though both are\nin horrendous relationships they still won't cross that line and we see their\nprogression through the years. While this animated short isn't nearly as funny\nor entertaining as some of Mulloy's best films, it still contains a certain\ncreative style that makes it worth seeing as long as you have a dark sense of\nhumor. I thought this was a pretty smart little movie that worked well because\nof the twist and turns in the love story. This isn't your typical love story\nbut I really liked the way the two characters struggled with what they should\ndo with their relationship. Some of your typical, dirty Mulloy humor comes\ninto play and especially during a dream sequence where a man has his you know\nwhat burned off. The animation is the same type that you expect from Mulloy\nand I think it fits the material just fine.

God carved these ten laws into the rock with His own hand. Exodus\n20:14 states one of them, the 7th commandment, as, \u201cYou shall not commit\nadultery.\u201d This law addresses relationships, sexuality, and encompasses both\nphysical and emotional sin. Adultery encompasses the many sins of the flesh,\ndriven by uncontrolled passions and lusts. It often stems from other sins\nincluding covetousness. It also is a violation of the body, which is God\u2019s\ntemple. When God commanded people not to commit adultery, He was trying to\nprotect their bodies, hearts, and souls.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.581031322479248\n'Thou Shalt not Commit Adultery' - 7th Commandment Meaning\nPhoto credit: \u00a9Getty Images/Image Source\n## What Are the Ten Commandments?\nWhen God called the descendants of Jacob out of Egypt, He called them out of\nslavery and away from being sojourners in a foreign land. They were called to\nbecome a nation, and a nation needs to have laws which govern it. For Israel,\nthey were not to be the rules and institutions of man. Instead, God set down\nthe laws for His people to follow. In fact, the initial system of governance\nwas for there to be no king, no president, or any recognizable executive\nauthority. Instead, during the days of Moses and Joshua, God communicated with\nthe people through leaders in the Tabernacle. Eventually the Judges were\ninstituted, and then kings. The first of His laws He gave to Israel after they\nleft Israel, at Mount Sinai.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.524633407592773\nThe Seventh Commandment - Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery\nAdultery begins in the mind  \nThe Bible labels humanity's obsession with self gratification for what it is:\nlust. \u201cFor all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of\nthe eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 17\nAnd the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will\nof God abideth for ever.\u201d 1 John 2:16-17. Lust is the beginning of adultery\nand immorality. \u201cYou have heard that it was said by them of old time, You\nshall not commit adultery.\u201d said Jesus Christ. \u201cBut I say unto you, That\nwhosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her\nalready in his heart.\u201d Matthew 5:27-28\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.347604751586914\n'Thou Shalt not Commit Adultery' - 7th Commandment Meaning\nThere are also several moments in the Bible which demonstrate the powerful\nevil influence of lust, and the repercussions of adultery. These records\ninclude when David committed adultery with Bathsheba, Uriah\u2019s wife, and\nmurdered her husband when she became pregnant. The account is in 2 Samuel 11.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.334110736846924\n'Thou Shalt not Commit Adultery' - 7th Commandment Meaning\n2\\. You shall not make idols, worship them, and I shall love those who obey my\nrules.\n3\\. You shall not take the name of the Lord in vain.\n4\\. Remember the Sabbath, my day of rest, and keep it holy, by resting like I\ndid.\n5\\. Honor your father and mother.\n6\\. Do not murder.\n7\\. Do not commit adultery.\n8\\. Do not steal.\n9\\. Do not lie about yourself or others.\n10\\. Do not want what God has given to others.\n## What Does Jesus Say about Adultery?\nInfidelity to one\u2019s spouse is a serious matter in the Bible; under the Old\nTestament system of laws, adultery was punishable by stoning. In fact, Jesus\nsaved a woman from this very punishment in John 8:1-11, extending grace and\nforgiveness to her. While He gave her grace, He was not silent about how\ndeeply offensive to God it is when some commits adultery. He is the one who\nclarified the extent of sin through adultery;  \u201cYou have heard that it was\nsaid, \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019  But I say to you that everyone who\nlooks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her\nin his heart\u201d (Matthew 5:27-28).\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.301877021789551\n'Thou Shalt not Commit Adultery' - 7th Commandment Meaning\n> \u201cNow the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity,\n> sensuality\u201d (Galatians 5:19).\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.296611785888672\n'Thou Shalt not Commit Adultery' - 7th Commandment Meaning\n> \u201cFor the man who does not love his wife but divorces her, says the Lord, the\n> God of Israel, covers his garment with violence, says the Lord of hosts. So\n> guard yourselves in your spirit, and do not be faithless\u201d (Malachi 2:16).\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.263931751251221\nThe Seventh Commandment - Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery\nAdultery is the violation of the marriage covenant by wilful participation in\nsexual activity with someone other than one's spouse. Since God's law\nsanctions sexual relationships only within a legitimate marriage, the command\nnot to commit adultery covers in principle all varieties of sexual immorality.\nNo sexual relationship of any sort should occur outside of marriage. That is\nthe message of this Commandment. In much of the world sexual immorality is no\nlonger regarded as a significant social evil. God however, categorically\ncondemns all forms of sexual immorality (Revelation 21:8).\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.250656604766846\nThe Seventh Commandment - Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery\nEqually damaging is the personal abasement that flows from sexual immorality.\nIt can be denied but it cannot be avoided. Paul told Christians in the\nlicentiously infamous city of Corinth, \u201cFlee fornication. Every sin that a man\ndoeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against\nhis own body.\u201d 1 Corinthians 6:18. These warnings apply equally to men and\nwomen because \u201cGod shows no partiality.\u201d Acts 10:34. Consider the disastrous\neffects of the sexual revolution. The explosion in sexually transmissible\ndiseases (STDs) is an international disgrace. STDs account for many of the\nmost commonly reported infectious diseases in the world. AIDS alone takes a\nfrightening toll in lives and suffering and rivals the most deadly epidemics\nin history. Treatments and medical research for cures are expensive.\nIronically, all this is avoidable because these diseases are spread almost\nexclusively through sexual promiscuity or perverted practices.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.174017906188965\n'Thou Shalt not Commit Adultery' - 7th Commandment Meaning\nGod\u2019s love is unwavering, but man is weak. Ultimately, the Lord can supply the\nstrength and support people need to stay the course and remain faithful in\ntheir marriages through the Holy Spirit, other people, and His love.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.172389984130859\nThe Seventh Commandment - Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery\nBut of adultery God warns, \u201cAnd why will you, my son, be ravished with a\nstrange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 21 For the ways of man are\nbefore the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. 22 His own\niniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the\ncords of his sins.\u201d Proverbs 5:20-22. Again concerning adultery we are warned,\n\u201cCan a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? 28 Can one\ngo upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? 29 So he that goeth in to his\nneighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.\u201d Proverbs\n6:27-29. \u201cWound and dishonour shall he [the adulterer] get; and his reproach\nshall not be wiped away.\u201d Proverbs 6:33. Are these warnings nothing but\nunenlightened, outdated rhetoric? Don't believe it! Instead, consider the\nworldwide havoc wreaked by sex outside of marriage.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.154780387878418\n'Thou Shalt not Commit Adultery' - 7th Commandment Meaning\nThe full set of commandments are, paraphrased:\n1\\. I am the Lord your God who has rescued you from Egypt, and you shall have\nno other gods besides me.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.053575038909912\nThe Seventh Commandment - Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery\nContrary to the opinions of most people, sexual fantasies are anything but\nharmless. Our actions originate in our thoughts and in the desires that float\nthrough our minds (James 1:14-15). Daydreams of illicit sexual encounters\nrender us especially vulnerable to the real thing. Make no mistake.\nOpportunities to sin will come. We need to heed Jesus' warning that adultery\nbegins in the heart.\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",

It is common to use the SI magnitude\nprefixes (e.g. milli-, mega- etc) with electronvolts. Because of the\nrelativistic equivalence between mass and energy, the eV is also sometimes\nused as a unit of mass. The Hartree (the atomic unit of energy) is commonly\nused in the field of computational chemistry since such units arise directly\nfrom the calculation algorithms without any need for conversion.

With the exception of his\noriginal Leeds Music deal \u2014 which included seven songs, among them \u201cSong for\nWoody\u201d and \u201cTalkin\u2019 New York\u201d \u2014 Dylan eventually took full control of all his\ncopyrights from those catalogs; Leeds was sold in 1964 to MCA, which became\nUniversal.\n\nThe Universal deal also includes Dylan\u2019s shares in a number of songs he has\nwritten with other songwriters. But of the more than 600 titles included in\nthe deal, there are a handful by members of the Band, which Dylan was long\nassociated with \u2014 including Robbie Robertson\u2019s song \u201cThe Weight\u201d \u2014 that Dylan\nowns the copyright to but did not compose.\n\nBut the agreement does not include any of Dylan\u2019s unreleased songs. It also\ndoesn\u2019t cover any work Dylan writes in the future, leaving open the\npossibility that he could choose to work with another publisher for that\nmaterial.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.22219029068946838\n5 Surprising Facts About Bob Dylan's Best-Selling Albums and Songs\nhtml\n/((((((\\\\\\\\\n=======((((((((((\\\\\\\\\\\n     ((           \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n     ( (*    _/      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n       \\    /  \\      \\\\\\\\\\\\________________\n        |  |   |       </                  ((\\\\\\\\\n        o_|   /        /             AP, LLC  \\ \\\\\\\\    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n             |  ._    (                        \\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n             | /                       /       /    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\     \\\\\n     .______/\\/     /                 /       /         \\\\\\\n    / __.____/    _/         ________(       /\\\n   / / / ________/`_________'         \\     /  \\_\n  / /  \\ \\                             \\   \\ \\_  \\\n ( <    \\ \\                             >  /    \\ \\\n  \\/     \\\\_                           / /       > )\n          \\_|                         / /       / /\n                                    _//       _//\n                                   /_|       /_|\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.12907902896404266\n5 Surprising Facts About Bob Dylan's Best-Selling Albums and Songs\n\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.009091809391975403\n5 Surprising Facts About Bob Dylan's Best-Selling Albums and Songs\nSyndication Attribution\nGeneric Page Content\nBottom Recirc\n* Categories\n  * Current Mortgage Rates\n  * Best Mortgage Lenders\n  * How Much Home Can You Afford\n  * Best Mortgage Refinance\n  * Everything About Reverse Mortgages\n  * Best Credit Cards\n  * Best Banks\n  * Best Savings Accounts\n  * Best Moving Companies\n\n  * Best of Money\n  * Best Student Loans\n  * Best Student Loan Refinance\n  * Best Credit Repair\n  * Best Personal Loans\n  * Best Auto Insurance\n  * Cheapest Car Insurance\n  * Best Home Insurance\n  * Best Life Insurance\n  * Best Home Warranties\n\n  * Resources\n  * Newsletters\n  * Best Banks\n  * Best Colleges\n  * Best Hospitals\n  * Best Places to Live\n  * Best Places to Travel\n  * Best Travel Insurance\n  * Best Pet Insurance\n\n  * Money\n  * About\n  * Contact\n  * Team\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Do Not Sell My Personal Information\n  * Your California Privacy Rights\n  * Licenses & Disclosures\n  * Advertising\n  * Sitemap\n  * Careers\n\nConnect\n\nPhysical Address\n\nMoney Group, LLC  \nDistrito T-Mobile  \n250 Convention Blvd  \nSan Juan, PR 00907\n\nMailing Address\n\nMetro Office Park  \n7 calle 1, Suite 204  \nGuaynabo, PR 00968\n\nBBB Rating A+\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 Money Group, LLC.

I just explained he is, after Alisson, the best\nstopper in the league from preventing expected goals. You deserve to play.\u201d\n\nThose were the words of Ten Hag on Friday in defence of the maligned Andre\nOnana. The Manchester United No 1 was the focus of much debate following two\nmajor goalkeeping errors against Galatasaray in the Champions League on\nWednesday, but he retained enough faith from his manager to play against\nNewcastle.\n\nThe crowd at St James\u2019 Park relished every touch Onana had on Saturday night,\nhoping he could be goaded into another blunder. Newcastle\u2019s first corner saw\nthem flood the six-yard box hoping Onana would be overwhelmed when trying to\nclaim the ball. The 27-year-old made an ambitious if ultimately misguided\nattempt to punch the cross away and got nowhere near the ball.\n\nIf Onana was unflustered by Newcastle\u2019s efforts, the same could not be said\nfor his team-mates. Early into the game Diogo Dalot opted to take the ball\nround his goalkeeper rather than give it to him when clearing a cross. In the\n37th minute, a direct free kick from Kieran Trippier left Onana rooted to the\nspot on its way to crashing off the crossbar.\n\nOnana managed three saves across regulation time and could not do much about\nGordon\u2019s goal. He is likely to remain Ten Hag\u2019s No 1 (at least until we know\nmore about his status for the upcoming AFCON tournament), but it\u2019s going to\ntake some time \u2014 and some quieter performances \u2014 before he earns back the\ngoodwill from the Manchester United fanbase.\n\nThe Cameroon international\u2019s passing ability is curbed by a back four and\nmidfield that has little idea as to how to build from the back properly. His\ntendency to parry shots rather than catch them outright is mildly concerning\nto onlookers and, while he is capable of \u201cHollywood saves\u201d, he does not exude\nan air of calm that the odd (and often changing) back four in front of him\nsorely needs.\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",

Mississippi had the lowest per-capita real GDP, at 35,555 U.S.\ndollars. While not a state, the District of Columbia had a per capita GDP of\nmore than 192,000 U.S. dollars.  \n  \n\n##  What is real GDP?\n\nA country\u2019s real GDP is a measure that shows the value of the goods and\nservices produced by an economy and is adjusted for inflation. The real GDP of\na country helps economists to see the health of a country\u2019s economy and its\nstandard of living. Downturns in GDP growth can indicate financial\ndifficulties, such as the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, when the U.S. GDP\ndecreased by 2.5 percent. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on\nU.S. GDP, shrinking the economy 2.8 percent. The U.S. economy rebounded in\n2021, however, growing by nearly six percent.  \n  \n\n## Why real GDP per capita matters\n\nReal GDP per capita takes the GDP of a country, state, or metropolitan area\nand divides it by the number of people in that area. Some argue that per-\ncapita GDP is more important than the GDP of a country, as it is a good\nindicator of whether or not the country\u2019s population is getting wealthier,\nthus increasing the standard of living in that area. The best measure of\nstandard of living when comparing across countries is thought to be GDP per\ncapita at purchasing power parity (PPP) which uses the prices of specific\ngoods to compare the absolute purchasing power of a countries currency.\n\nRead more\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 8.42088794708252\nGDP by State 2024\nThe ten states with the largest GDP per capita are:\nState| GDP Per Capita 2022  \n---|---  \nDistrict of Columbia| $96,728  \nConnecticut| $84,972  \nMassachusetts| $84,945  \nNew Jersey| $78,700  \nNew York| $78,089  \nCalifornia| $77,339  \nWashington| $75,698  \nNew Hampshire| $74,663  \nColorado| $74,167  \nWyoming| $71,342\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.485317230224609\nGDP by State 2024\nFour states contribute over $1 trillion to the U.S. GDP: California, Texas,\nNew York, and Florida.

He travels around on a single roller, equipped with cleaning tools. M-O\neventually befriends WALL-E after all his attempts to clean the dirty robot,\nfollowing him all over the ship. His timely arrival in the garbage disposal\narea proves significant when he unintentionally wedges himself between the\nclosing doors to prevent WALL-E and EVE from being jettisoned out into space.\nHe then fully cleans WALL-E and accompanies him and EVE into bringing the\nplant to the holo-detector on the lido deck so the Axiom can jump to Earth.\nM-O also joined in the fight against the Stewards with EVE and the defective\nrobots (though he is unable to do much damage). Later, WALL\u2022E accidentally\ndrops the plant when he sideswipes the holo-detector and the plant is thought\nto be lost until M-O finds it thanks to his functionality that detects foreign\ncontaminants. He lets other robots and humans pass it all the way up to EVE.\nAfter they arrive back on Earth, M-O ushers the other robots into giving\nWALL-E and EVE some privacy as they share a tender moment. Together, M-O,\nWALL-E, EVE, and all the humans work together to bring Earth back to its\nformer glory.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.5346479415893555\nWALL-E | Rotten Tomatoes\n## WALL-E videos\n\nWALL-E: Trailer 1\n\nWALL-E: Trailer 1\n\nTRAILER 2:22\n\nView All Videos\n## WALL-E Photos\n\nSee all photos\n## Movie Info\n\nWALL-E, short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class, is the last robot\nleft on Earth.

In the last reported year, the multinational\ne-commerce company's net revenue was almost 576 billion U.S. dollars, up from\n514 billion U.S. dollars in 2022.  \nAmazon.com, a U.S. electronic commerce company originally founded in 1994, is\nthe world\u2019s largest online retailer of books, clothing, electronics, music,\nand many more goods. As of 2022, the company generates the majority of it's\nnet revenues through online retail product sales, followed by third-party\nretail seller services, cloud computing services, and retail subscription\nservices including Amazon Prime.  \n  \n\n## From seller to digital environment\n\nThrough Amazon, consumers are able to purchase goods at a rather discounted\nprice from both small and large companies as well as from other users. Both\nnew and used goods are sold on the website. Due to the wide variety of goods\navailable at prices which often undercut local brick-and-mortar retail\nofferings, Amazon has dominated the retailer market. As of 2022, Amazon\u2019s\nbrand worth amounts to over 281 billion U.S. dollars, topping the likes of\ncompanies such as Walmart, Ikea, as well as digital competitors Alibaba and\neBay. One of Amazon's first forays into the world of hardware was its e-reader\nKindle, one of the most popular e-book readers worldwide. More recently,\nAmazon has also released several series of own-branded products and a voice-\ncontrolled virtual assistant, Alexa.  \n  \n\n## Headquartered in North America\n\nDue to its location, Amazon offers more services in North America than\nworldwide. As a result, the majority of the company\u2019s net revenue in 2021 was\nactually earned in the United States and Canada. In 2022, approximately 316\nbillion U.S. dollars was earned in North America compared to only roughly 118\nbillion U.S. dollars internationally.\n\nRead more\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.3740029335021973\nAmazon sales, Amazon revenue and Amazon profits in Q4\nOperating income also grew in the quarter.

The\nassociation was designed to represent the interests of motor car users, as\nwell as to oversee the burgeoning international motor sport scene. In 1922,\nthe AIACR delegated the organisation of automobile racing to the Commission\nSportive Internationale (CSI), which would set the regulations for\ninternational Grand Prix motor racing. The European Drivers' Championship was\nintroduced in 1931, a title awarded to the driver with the best results in the\nselected Grands Prix. Upon the resumption of motor racing after the Second\nWorld War, the AIACR was renamed the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de\nl'Automobile. The FIA established a number of new racing categories, among\nthem Formulas One and Two, and created the first World Championship, the\nFormula One World Drivers' Championship, in 1950.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.858795404434204\nF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile - Wikipedia\nStarting in 2022, the FIA and FIM jointly sanctioned the World Rally-Raid\nChampionship.

The actor became the most nominated performer in\n2017, when she got her 20th Oscar nomination for her performance in Florence\nFoster Jenkins.\n\nStreep has been a consistent Oscars contender since 1979, when she gained her\nfirst nod for her performance in The Deer Hunter. While she lost that year,\nStreep returned to the Oscars the next year to scoop up the Best Supporting\nActress award for her role in Kramer vs. Kramer. Streep, who has won the Oscar\nthree times over her career, last won an Academy Award for Best Actress in\n2012 for her performance as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady.\n\nIf Streep wins for The Post, she will tie Katharine Hepburn\u2019s record for the\nmost acting awards ever, with a total of four.\n\n## More Must-Reads From TIME\n\n  * The Fight to Free Evan Gershkovich\n  * Inside the White House Program to Share America's Secrets\n  * Meet the 2024 Women of the Year\n  * Breaker Sunny Choi Is Heading to Paris\n  * Long COVID Doesn\u2019t Always Look Like You Think It Does\n  * Column: The New Antisemitism\n  * The 13 Best New Books to Read in March\n  * Want Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?

The film grossed nearly $700 million worldwide and made almost $300\nmillion more than the previous film, Mission: Impossible III.

Wells. Cruise played Ray Ferrier, a father\nprotecting his kids amidst a dangerous alien invasion.

The first film grossed almost half a\nbillion dollars at the box office, a theatrical run most other spy films could\nonly wish they had.

In the sequel, Ethan led his\nteam on a mission to prevent a biological weapon from being unleashed.\nUnfortunately, Mission: Impossible 2 was not as well-received as its\npredecessor, often prioritizing style over substance.

Hitting radio in June 2010, in advance of\nHands All Over\u2019s release, the track received a critical thumbs-up and,\nalongside a video featuring another one of Maroon 5\u2019s provocative but tongue-\nin-cheek storylines, started its ascent up the charts. Its subsequent,\ninexplicable stalling outside the US Top 10 (at No.14) and a peak of No.30 in\nthe UK seemed at odds with the song\u2019s obvious commercial direction. A later\nnomination at the following year\u2019s Grammys for Best Pop Performance By A Duo\nOr Group With A Vocal would give the song the credit it deserved, but it set\nthe Hands All Over campaign off on a shakier footing than had been expected.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.056221961975098\n'Hands All Over': How Maroon 5\u2019s Third Album Reached For Glory\nThat masterstroke was to be the floor-filling classic, \u201cMoves Like Jagger.\u201d\nSuper-producers Johan Schuster (Shellback) and Benjamin Levin worked with\nLevine on a treatment that was something of a gamble for the band, who had\nnever tried anything so obviously all-out pop. But bold actions sometimes\nconjure magic, and the decision to record the song with Levine\u2019s fellow judge\non the US reality show The Voice was nothing short of inspired. The chemistry\nbetween Levine and Christina Aguilera had already played out obviously on\nscreen and added a teasing narrative to a strong song. Aguilera\u2019s own musical\ncareer had proved erratic since her breakthrough with \u201cGenie In A Bottle,\u201d in\n1999, and her recent album, Bionic, had underperformed, so the collaboration\nmarked a timely opportunity for both parties to give their chart credentials a\nwelcome boost.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.029666423797607\nMaroon 5 - Wikipedia\nIn November 2011, Maroon 5 performed \"Moves Like Jagger\" and \"Stereo Hearts\"\nwith Travie McCoy on Saturday Night Live on November 5.[86] On November 20,\n2011, the band also performed the same songs along with Aguilera and Gym Class\nHeroes at the 2011 American Music Awards,[87] where the band won their first\nAMA for Favorite Pop Band/Duo/Group.

We've never really released a song like that. But it's exciting to\ndo something different, do something new.

They\nare Trailing Twelve Month PE Ratio or PE Ratio (TTM), Forward PE Ratio, or PE\nRatio without NRI. A new PE Ratio based on inflation-adjusted normalized PE\nRatio is called Shiller PE Ratio, after Yale professor Robert Shiller.\n\nIn the calculation of PE Ratio, the earnings per share used are the earnings\nper share over the past 12 months. For Forward PE Ratio, the earnings are the\nexpected earnings for the next twelve months. In the case of PE Ratio without\nNRI, the reported earnings less the non-recurring items are used.\n\nFor Shiller PE Ratio, the earnings of the past 10 years are inflation-adjusted\nand averaged. Since it looks at the average over the last 10 years, Shiller PE\nRatio is also called PE10.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.4576187133789062\nIntel (INTC) PE Ratio\nIn real business, earnings never stay constant. If a company can grow its\nearnings, it takes fewer years for the company to earn back the price you pay\nfor the stock. If a company's earnings decline it takes more years. As a\nshareholder, you want the company to earn back the price you pay as soon as\npossible. Therefore, lower P/E stocks are more attractive than higher P/E\nstocks so long as the PE Ratio is positive. Also for stocks with the same PE\nRatio, the one with faster growth business is more attractive.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.206155776977539\nIntel (INTC) Pe Ratio (TTM) - Zacks.com\nz2_fundamental_charts_seo end\nz2_charts_description start\n# About PE Ratio (TTM)\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio or P/E is price / earnings. It is the most commonly\nused metric for determining a company's value relative to its earnings. In\nthis example, we are using the actual earnings (EPS) for the trailing twelve\nmonths (or TTM).  A stock with a P/E ratio of 20, for example, is said to be\ntrading at 20 times its trailing twelve months earnings. In general, a lower\nnumber or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.976346492767334\nIntel (INTC) PE Ratio\nIntel's Earnings per Share (Diluted) for the three months ended in Dec. 2023\nwas $0.63.

For example, if a company earns $2\na share per year, and the stock is traded at $30, the PE Ratio is 15.\nTherefore it takes 15 years for the company to earn back the $30 you paid for\nits stock, assuming the earnings stays constant over the next 15 years.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.4339213371276855\nIntel (INTC) PE Ratio\nAs of today (2024-02-28), Intel's share price is $42.35.

Therapeutic Drugs\",\"businessSummary\":\"CytoMed Therapeutics Limited is a pre-clinical biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on harnessing its licensed proprietary technologies to create cell-based immunotherapies for the treatment of human cancers. The development of its technologies has been inspired by the clinical success of existing CAR-T in treating hematological malignancies, as well as the clinical limitations and commercial challenges in extrapolating the CAR-T principle into treatment of solid tumors. It is developing three product candidates: CTM-N2D, iPSC-gdNKT and CTM-GDT. CTM-N2D is its lead product candidate, and it consists of expanded gamma delta T cells grafted with NKG2DL-targeting CAR to enhance anti-cancer cytotoxicity. Its second product candidate, iPSC-gdNKT, utilizes iPSC as a starting material to generate gdNKT, which is a synthetic hybrid of a gamma delta T cell and a NK cell. Its third product candidate, CTM-GDT, consists of expanded allogeneic gamma delta T cells.\",\"address\":[\"#08-22 One Commonwealth\",\"1 Commonwealth

Kathy Bates breathes a new life to the\ncharacter and is to be applauded for her own interpretation of the iconic\nrole.\n\nNow, let's look at the most recent Annie from 2014. This movie utilizes a more\nmodern take and does a nice job including actors of color, but unfortunately\nfails to capture the Annie \u201ccharm\u201d held by the first two movies. The 2014\nmovie portrays Annie as a foster child instead of an orphan, which on one hand\ncould be seen as a positive representation of children in a non-traditional\nliving environment, but also seems to diminish the plot. I think that it\u2019s\ngood for children in foster care to have representation, but this would have\nbeen more beneficially executed in a new movie entirely different from Annie.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.15356993675231934\nAnnie (musical) - Wikipedia\nIn January 2011, Will Smith announced plans for a remake of Annie set in the\npresent day, produced with his wife Jada Pinkett Smith and rapper Jay-Z for\nrelease by Columbia Pictures.[60] This version was to star the Smiths'\ndaughter, Willow, as Annie; but as she had aged out of the part before\nproduction began, she was replaced by Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis.[61] Directed by Will\nGluck and released in 2014,[62][63] this version of Annie also stars Jamie\nFoxx as Will Stacks (an update of Warbucks),[64] Rose Byrne as Grace Farrell,\nand Cameron Diaz as Miss Hannigan.[65]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.5972907543182373\nAnnie (musical) - Wikipedia\n* ^ Kit, Borys (April 29, 2013). \"Jamie Foxx in Talks to Star in Sony's 'Annie' (Exclusive)\".

Then, Punjab (who\nwe\u2019ll get to in a bit) manages to throw the bomb out of the house before it\nexplodes. Annie is clearly very confused about what just happened, and Grace\nexplains to her that the Bolsheviks hate Mr. Warbucks because apparently \u201cHe\nis proof that the American system works\u201d. Also, in a much later scene,\nWarbucks literally says that the only things he loves are money, power, and\ncapitalism.

Despite a\nlopsided comparison in terms of the two teams' win\u2013loss records, three of the\nfour Pacers' losses were close, losing games 1\u20133 by an average of five\npoints.[57]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.8853976726531982\nIndiana Pacers - Wikipedia\nIn the 2010\u201311 season, the team went 2\u20133 in the first five games. On November\n9, in a home game against Denver, the team scored 54 points in the 3rd quarter\nalone, shooting 20\u201321 in the process, on the way to a 144\u2013113 rout of the\nNuggets. Led by Mike Dunleavy's 24 points in the period, the team set a\nfranchise record for most points in a quarter and was only four points short\nof the all-time NBA record for points in a quarter (58) set in the 1970s.[54]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.8242707252502441\nIndiana Pacers - Wikipedia\n#### 2022\u2013present: The Tyrese Haliburton era[edit]\nThe Pacers failed to qualify for the 2022 NBA Playoffs with a record of 25\u201357\nin the 2021\u201322 NBA season, which marks the first time the team failed to reach\nthe playoffs for consecutive seasons since 2007\u201310.[111] The 2021\u201322 season\nalso saw fan-favorite Lance Stephenson serve his third stint with the Pacers\nfranchise. During the season, the Pacers traded away core players including\nDomantas Sabonis, Caris LeVert, Justin Holiday, Jeremy Lamb, and Malcolm\nBrogdon over the summer. In return, the Pacers notably received multiple\nfirst\u2013round draft picks, sharpshooter Buddy Hield, veterans Daniel Theis and\nTristan Thompson, as well as young stars Tyrese Haliburton, Jalen Smith and\nAaron Nesmith, all lottery picks in the 2020 NBA draft.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.494748830795288\nIndiana Pacers - Wikipedia\nThe Pacers finished the 2006\u201307 season as one of the worst seasons in team\nhistory. The turning point of the season would be an 11-game losing streak\nthat started around the all-star break. Injuries to Jermaine O'Neal and\nMarquis Daniels, a lack of a solid backup point guard, the blockbuster trade\nmidway through the season that interrupted the team chemistry, poor defensive\nefforts, and being the NBA's worst offensive team were the main reasons\nleading to the team's struggles. The April 15 loss to New Jersey Nets knocked\nthe Pacers out of the playoffs for the first time since the 1996\u201397\nseason.[37]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.213626503944397\nIndiana Pacers - Wikipedia\nThat year teams split the four regular season meetings. They met in the\nEastern Conference Semifinals and split the first two games. The Pacers blew\nan 18-point lead, but still won Game 3 in Indianapolis. However, just as he\ndid a year earlier, Rasheed promised a win in Game 4 saying, \"When we return,\nwe will be tied at 2.\" The Pistons won Games 4 and 5. The Pacers, knowing a\nloss would lead to Miller's retirement, fought hard, but fell to the Pistons\n88\u201379.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.1637839078903198\nIndiana Pacers - Wikipedia\nDespite the adversity they had gone through, the Pacers made the playoffs for\nthe 13th time in 14 years. In the first round, Indiana defeated the Atlantic\nDivision champion Boston Celtics in seven games, winning Game 7 in Boston by\nthe decisive margin of 97\u201370, just the third time the Celtics had dropped a\nGame 7 at home.[33] The Pacers then advanced to the second round against the\nDetroit Pistons, in a rematch of the previous year's Eastern Conference\nFinals. The series featured games back at The Palace of Auburn Hills, the\nscene of the brawl that many assumed at the time had effectively ended the\nPacers' season. After losing Game 1, the Pacers won the next two games to take\na 2\u20131 lead. However, the Pacers could not repeat their victories against the\nPistons and lost the next three games, losing the series 4\u20132. The final game\n(Game 6) was on May 19, 2005; Reggie Miller, in his final NBA game, scored 27\npoints and received a huge standing ovation from the crowd. Despite Miller's\neffort, the Pacers lost, sending Miller into retirement without an NBA\nChampionship in his 18-year career, all with the Pacers.[34] Miller had his\nNo. 31 jersey retired by the Pacers on March 30, 2006, when the Pacers played\nthe Phoenix Suns.[35]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.8963467478752136\nIndiana Pacers - Wikipedia\nThe Pacers got off to a 13\u20132 start in 2002\u201303 but hit the wall after the All-\nStar break thanks in no small part to Ron Artest's multiple suspensions and\nfamily tragedies befalling Jermaine O'Neal, Jamaal Tinsley and Austin\nCroshere.

Consider this: Villeneuve released his\nfirst film in 1998 and his second in 2000, then essentially took a yearslong\nbreak to hit the reset button and, he recently told The Hollywood Reporter,\nlearn how to \u201capproach cinema differently.\u201d That involved observing theater\ndirectors at work and learning how better to communicate with actors. He\nresurfaced in 2008 with Next Floor, a nearly wordless satirical short film in\nwhich a gathering of formally dressed elites gorge on a feast of increasingly\nvile dishes. This isn\u2019t the sort of career path that always proceeds to\ndirecting the biggest films imaginable.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.9648280143737793\nAll 4 Denis Villeneuve Sci-Fi Movies, Ranked\nIt's been clear for a while now, and seems to get clearer and clearer with\neach new release, but Denis Villeneuve is undoubtedly one of the most exciting\nand consistently interesting filmmakers working today. He made his feature\ndirectorial debut in 1998 with August 32nd on Earth, and then over the next\ndecade or so made several more drama films in his home country of Canada:\nMaelstr\u00f6m (2000), Polytechnique (2009), and Incendies (2010). The last of\nthose got decent recognition internationally, partly thanks to it being\nnominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2011 Academy Awards.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.663151979446411\nEvery Denis Villeneuve Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\nThe French-Canadian film director Denis Villeneuve has quickly become one of\nthe most acclaimed, sought-after craftsmen for his ability to tell stories big\nand small. He is a meticulous filmmaker, known for recently delving into more\nemotionally vast science fiction stories that explore the complexities of the\nhuman condition and the genre itself in equal measure. With what is his\nbiggest and most ambitious film yet, Dune: Part Two, now in theaters ,it is\nworth taking a look back on all the films he has made up until this point to\nsee how his career has grown over the decades.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.591834783554077\nThe Best Denis Villeneuve Movies, Ranked\n##  2\\. Polytechnique (2009)\nThis, like Dune, might have gone horribly awry, but for much different\nreasons. Villeneuve returned to feature films after nearly a decade away with\na dramatization of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique massacre, a 1989 incident in which\na man driven by misogynist motivations and armed with an assault rifle killed\n14 women and injured 14 of their fellow students at a Montreal university.\nShot in stark black-and-white with a sense of on-the-ground immediacy,\nPolytechnique largely follows two students present at the massacre, both\naspiring engineers: Val\u00e9rie (Karine Vanasse) and Jean-Francois (S\u00e9bastien\nHuberdeau). Short (just 77 minutes, with credits), shocking, and\nunforgettable, it\u2019s unsparing in its depiction of the horrific event but never\nfeels exploitative. Though the attack itself takes up much of the film, its\nfinal stretch reveals it\u2019s less concerned with attempting to make sense of\nwhat happened than what happens next to those who survive \u2014 some of whom\nstruggle to find meaning and a will to go on.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.1730856895446777\nThe Best Denis Villeneuve Movies, Ranked\n##  4\\. Blade Runner 2049 (2017)\nIn some respects, that makes it a companion piece to Blade Runner 2049.\nVilleneuve\u2019s follow-up to Blade Runner largely throws out the detective-story\nframework of the original to explore the wider universe suggested by Ridley\nScott\u2019s 1982 science-fiction classic. The film follows K (Ryan Gosling), a\nreplicant blade runner who makes a discovery that leads him on a journey that\nwill find him questioning the relationship between humanity and its android\ncreations \u2014 and, by extension, the nature of existence itself. Less a sequel\nthan a companion piece (though Harrison Ford does make a return as the\noriginal\u2019s hero, Rick Deckard), the film isn\u2019t short on action set pieces but\nallows plenty of room for philosophical pondering in the spaces between them.\nAnother Deakins collaboration, Blade Runner 2049 also offers one stunning\nimage after another \u2014 none more memorable than a ruined Las Vegas, though some\ncome close. It\u2019s the sort of film where it\u2019s sometimes hard to believe what\nyou\u2019re seeing, making it all the more remarkable in an era in which corner-\ncutting effects have made images of the extraordinary seem pretty dull.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.9594218730926514\nThe Best Denis Villeneuve Movies, Ranked\n##  9\\. Incendies (2010)\nIn addition to reconsidering his approach to film, Villeneuve spent the years\nafter his first films working on screenplays for Polytechnique and Incendies,\nwhich he made one after the other. An adaptation (co-written with Val\u00e9rie\nBeaugrand-Champagne) of Lebanese Canadian playwright Wajdi Mouawad\u2019s 2003\nplay, the latter flits between the past and the present as it depicts a\ntragedy whose full scope doesn\u2019t become apparent until all the pieces have\nbeen put together. In the present, Quebecois twins Jeanne (M\u00e9lissa D\u00e9sormeaux-\nPoulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudette) respond differently to the reading of their\nmother Nawan\u2019s (Lubna Azabal) will, which includes sealed envelopes to the\nfather they didn\u2019t know was still alive and a brother they didn\u2019t know\nexisted. Simon wants nothing to do with it. Jeanne heads to the unnamed Middle\nEastern country of her birth in an attempt to honor her mother\u2019s final wishes.\nAs her quest proceeds, and grows more confusing, the film depicts scenes from\nNawan\u2019s past and a life about which her children knew nothing.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.8551769256591797\nEvery Denis Villeneuve Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nNot injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode.\n##  11  'Maelstr\u00f6m' (2000)\nImage via Alliance Atlantis\nIf you haven\u2019t heard about this film, strap in because a lot is going on here.\nIn a most literal sense, it follows Bibiane Champagne (Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze) who\nfinds herself drawn to and soon romantically involved with the son of a man\nshe killed with her car. This is all in the aftermath after she has an\nabortion and is all narrated by a giant fish as it is being slaughtered. No,\nthis is not a joke and is actually a key part of the entire narrative as it is\nthrough this fish\u2019s telling of the story that we enter into the film. The\nfish, brought to life with some unique animatronics, is cut into pieces\nmultiple times in a manner that almost becomes humorous the more it happens as\nhe struggles to get his monologues out. It is a strange narrative choice and,\nmuch like the film on the whole, not a wholly successful one.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.7886781692504883\nEvery Denis Villeneuve Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\n#####  Sicario\n\nR\n\nAction\n\nCrime\n\nDocumentary\n\nDrama\n\nMystery\n\nThriller\n\n  \nAn idealistic FBI agent is enlisted by a government task force to aid in the\nescalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nRelease Date\n\n     September 17, 2015 \n\nDirector\n\n     Denis Villeneuve \n\nCast\n\n     Emily Blunt , Benicio Del Toro , Josh Brolin , Victor Garber , Jon Bernthal , Daniel Kaluuya\n\nRuntime\n\n     120\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.7540957927703857\nThe Best Denis Villeneuve Movies, Ranked\n##  5\\. Enemy (2013)\nVilleneuve\u2019s Hollywood work has made his name synonymous with the fantastic,\nbut, talking fish aside (see: No. 10), he didn\u2019t part ways with our\nunderstanding of reality until his final (at least to date) Canadian film. An\nadaptation of Jos\u00e9 Saramago\u2019s novel The Double scripted by Javier Gull\u00f3n, the\nsurreal film opens with a scene set in a secret club in which women impale\ntarantulas on high heels and only becomes stranger from there. Jake Gyllenhaal\nstars as Adam, a glum Toronto history professor whose life becomes unhinged\nwhen he spots his exact duplicate, Anthony Claire, playing a bellhop in a\nCanadian comedy. After Adam reaches out, his life and Anthony\u2019s (and the lives\nof their partners, played by M\u00e9lanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon) start to overlap\nin uncomfortable ways in what becomes a power struggle. Shot before Prisoners\nbut released after, Enemy finds Villeneuve already playing with the\nconventions of genre filmmaking as he invests even seemingly mundane moments\nwith a sense of dread. What it\u2019s all about remains up for discussion,\nseemingly by design. It\u2019s filled with references to history repeating itself\nand interest in the ways performative masculinity poisons its characters\u2019\nrelationships with women, and leads to an unforgettable final image. But\nVilleneuve feels no obligation to settle on a single theme or reveal Enemy\u2019s\nsecrets. It\u2019s opaque and inconclusive and all the more haunting for it.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.726377010345459\nEvery Denis Villeneuve Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\nBuy tickets here\n##  1  'Arrival' (2016)\nImage via Paramount Pictures\nHowever much Dune is an impressive achievement, the top spot in Villenevue\u2019s\nfilmography could only have been Arrival. A science fiction film that flaunts\nconvention to tell a story about connection with what draws us together even\namid great strife, it is the best work of not just the director but of cinema\nbroadly in the 21st century. Based on the equally magnificent 1998 short story\n\u201cStory of Your Life\u201d by Ted Chiang, it follows linguistics professor Louise\nBanks as she is called to help communicate with mysterious life forms that\nhave landed in a spacecraft hovering above Montana. Played by the perpetually\nunderrated Amy Adams in one of her best performances to date, Banks will have\nto find a way to build a connection with not just the aliens but also with her\nfellow people across the world who are on a razor\u2019s edge as they deal with\ntheir spacecraft hovering above them. Tensions are high and fear begins to\ntake hold as existing conflicts are exacerbated, threatening to send the world\ninto war over what to do with the first contact of this kind. The delicately\nemotional manner in which the story grounds itself, looking through time at\nlove and loss, makes this one of the most deeply affecting films of all time.\nIt reveals who we are underneath it all when faced with the unimaginable.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.5968148708343506\nThe Best Denis Villeneuve Movies, Ranked\n##  6\\. Sicario (2015)\nIt would have been easy for a director to simplify screenwriter Taylor\nSheridan\u2019s story of Mexican drug cartels and escalating violence along the\nU.S.-Mexico border into a simple clash between good and evil. Instead, Sicario\nplunges headlong into the moral murk, following Kate (Emily Blunt), an\nidealistic FBI agent, as she joins a Joint Task Force headed by Matt (Josh\nBrolin), a deceptively glib CIA agent, and including Alejandro (Benicio del\nToro), a former Mexican prosecutor who subsequently pursued other interests.\nFrom the opening raid (an almost otherworldly scene set in an American suburb)\nto a firefight that erupts at a border crossing clogged with unsuspecting\ntravelers to a tense final confrontation best left unspoiled, Villeneuve keeps\nthe tension high, sometimes letting it boil over in breathtaking violent\nscenes. But, once again, it\u2019s the human costs exacted by these conflicts that\nare his main concern. Pair this with Incendies, and you\u2019ll find one rhyming\nelement after another.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.424359083175659\nEvery Denis Villeneuve Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\n#####  Blade Runner 2049\n\nR\n\nSci-Fi\n\nAction\n\nDrama\n\nMystery\n\nYoung Blade Runner K's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track\ndown former Blade Runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years.\n\nRelease Date\n\n     October 6, 2017 \n\nDirector\n\n     Denis Villeneuve \n\nCast\n\n     Ryan Gosling , Ana De Armas , Dave Bautista , Harrison Ford , Robin Wright , Sylvia Hoeks\n\nRuntime\n\n     164 minutes\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.3269073963165283\nThe Best Denis Villeneuve Movies, Ranked\n##  1\\. Arrival (2016)\nEven factoring in both Dunes, Arrival remains the ultimate example of\nVilleneuve\u2019s skill telling the biggest and smallest possible stories at once.\nAdapted by screenwriter Eric Heisserer from a short story by Ted Chiang, the\nfilm stars Amy Adams as Louise, a linguist called into action when 12\nmysterious spacecraft make an unexpected appearance across the globe.\nBeautifully shot by Bradford Young, the film uses spooky grays and earthy\ngreens to create an uneasy mood that only intensifies as it progresses. It\nalso features a sci-fi rarity: aliens that seem truly alien. The come in the\nform of cephalopod-like creatures of obvious intelligence but with motives\nmade indiscernible by a mode of communication completely at odds with human\nexperience. The need to communicate turns into a race against time as the\nships and their mysterious pilots trigger a global crisis that threatens to\ntip over into catastrophe. Despite those stakes, and in ways best left\nunrevealed for those who haven\u2019t seen the movie, Arrival remains Louise\u2019s\nstory, both in its emphasis on communication and understanding and its\nunderlying concern with fate and the way life is inextricable with death.\nFitting for a film in which history moves in a circle, which has been a\nVilleneuve concern since August 32nd on Earth and seems likely to remain one\nfor the length of what\u2019s been an unpredictable career.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.195768117904663\nEvery Denis Villeneuve Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\nRelated Topics\n\n  * Movie Features\n  * Denis Villeneuve\n  * Dune (2021)\n  * Arrival (2016)\n  * Blade Runner 2049 (2017)\n  * Dune: Part Two (2024)\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.171285390853882\nThe Best Denis Villeneuve Movies, Ranked\n##  11\\. August 32nd on Earth (1998) and 10. Maelstr\u00f6m (2000) (tie)\nVilleneuve\u2019s first two features are so of a piece it\u2019s hard to think of them\nseparately. A car accident plays a central role in both, as does an ambiguous\nrelationship between two people who may or may not belong together set along\nthe thin line between life and death (though only one is narrated by the\nrepeatedly beheaded corpse of a talking fish).\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.0857744216918945\nThe Best Denis Villeneuve Movies, Ranked\nYet that\u2019s precisely where Villeneuve finds himself after completing a two-\npart adaptation of Frank Herbert\u2019s science-fiction landmark Dune, a project\nonce widely deemed unadaptable after David Lynch\u2019s attempt in 1984. Yet Dune\nmight as well have been custom-made for Villeneuve, who designed storyboards\nfor an imagined adaptation with his best friend as a teen. To work, any\nadaptation of Herbert\u2019s book has to capture the violence, moral ambiguity, and\nhuman drama of its far-future world without losing the spectacle or\nhallucinatory weirdness.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.072535991668701\nEvery Denis Villeneuve Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\nEven as it all feels like it has been somewhat cheapened by a woefully out-of-\nplace sequel that inexplicably continued without Blunt or Villeneuve, the\noriginal film still offers much to admire. The vast beauty of the visual\nsettings is brilliantly captured even as it masks the ugliness underneath it\nall. Tying this all together is the score of the late J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson, a\nfrequent collaborator of Villeneuve who was lost far too soon. The track\n\u2018Beast\u2019 in particular is the frightening yet still outstanding beating heart\nof the film, rattling you to your core as you look upon the nightmares and\nbrutality on display. It leaves you constantly on edge, aware of the ease with\nwhich this world can easily tip into the void of violence at the call of those\nwho operate immense power over it. The people who get unknowingly caught up in\nthis world are merely pawns, collateral damage. The final frames make this\ndynamic clear: leaving you with a profound sense of how tenuous life is for\nthose deemed expendable in an ongoing, bloody power struggle.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.0652289390563965\nEvery Denis Villeneuve Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\n#####  Prisoners\n\nR\n\nCrime\n\nDocumentary\n\nDrama\n\nThriller\n\nWhen Keller Dover's daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into\nhis own hands as the police pursue multiple leads and the pressure mounts.\n\nRelease Date\n\n     September 18, 2013 \n\nDirector\n\n     Denis Villeneuve \n\nCast\n\n     Hugh Jackman , Jake Gyllenhaal , Viola Davis , Maria Bello , Terrence Howard , Melissa Leo\n\nRuntime\n\n     153\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.0251293182373047\nThe Best Denis Villeneuve Movies, Ranked\n##  7\\. Dune: Part Two (2024)\nWith no plans to make a sequel if the first entry in Villeneuve\u2019s adaptation\nunderperformed, Dune might have been an orphaned half-adaptation. Fortunately,\nthat didn\u2019t happen, allowing Villeneuve to finish the story (though a rumored\nadaptation of Dune Messiah and some obvious dangling plot threads strongly\nhint there might be more to come). If the first Dune has a slight edge over\nits sequel, it\u2019s only because there\u2019s less to discover here than the first\ntime around, but even that\u2019s relatively speaking, given remarkable elements\nlike a long monochrome sequence under a black sun and the breathtaking imagery\nof sandworms stretched across the horizon. Some of its greatest strengths have\nnothing to do with strange worlds and special effects. The way Zendaya plays\nChani\u2019s shifting emotions as Paul assumes what might be his fated role as a\nmessiah destined to be responsible for countless deaths captures the story\u2019s\ntragic underpinnings with little need for dialogue. Considered as one long\nmovie, the two Dune installments combine to make a stunning addition to the\ncanon of classic science-fiction films.\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",

But, in fact, he was a man with deep religious and political\nsentiments who rose from destitution to become one of the most influential\nmusic figures in the last 20 years.\u201d\n\nMake that 50. Marley\u2019s stature and influence as a singer, songwriter, and\ninternational pop-culture prophet have only grown since those words were\nwritten. He is a cornerstone of 21st-century music, covered by countless\nsingers, sampled and quoted by just as many hip-hop acts whose artistic DNA is\nshaped profoundly by the Jamaican music Marley defined. His artistic\nfearlessness and social commitment remain an inspiration to activists, musical\nand otherwise. His songs of freedom have become universal hymns.\n\n\u201cMarley sang about tyranny and anger, about brutality and apocalypse, in\nenticing tones, not dissonant ones,\u201d Mikal Gilmore wrote in 2005. \u201cHis\nmelodies take up a resonance in our minds, in our lives, and that can provide\nadmission to the songs\u2019 meanings\u2026 He was the master of mellifluent\ninsurgency.\u201d\n\nThose melodies sing on.

A Complete Guide | Mailchimp\n##  What is ROI?\n\nIn business, your investments are the resources you put into improving your\ncompany, like time and money. The return is the profit you make as a result of\nyour investments.\n\nROI is generally defined as the ratio of net profit over the total cost of the\ninvestment.\n\nROI is most useful to your business goals when it refers to something concrete\nand measurable, to identify your investment's gains and financial returns.\nAnalyzing investments in terms of monetary cost is the most popular method\nbecause it\u2019s the easiest to quantify, although it\u2019s also possible to calculate\nROI using time as an investment.\n\nThe ROI metric or ROI figure is also applied across different types of\ninvestments and industries: return on equity, return on ad spend, return on\nassets, social return on investment, etc.\n\n## Examples of investments\n\nThe term \u201cinvestments\u201d is often used to refer to buying stock in a company or\nfinancing another person\u2019s business venture. Investments you make in your own\nbusiness are distinct from these, but have a similar purpose: to increase your\nprofit.\n\nDepending on your industry, the types of investments you make can look very\ndifferent. They don\u2019t always have to be tangible, like an initial investment\nin new equipment or higher quality materials. An online store owner or app\ndeveloper, for example, might make investments in more digital goods like\ncloud-based storage services or a subscription to a new content management\nsoftware, that might have maintenance costs, for which it would be desirable\nto identify the return of investment or ROI.\n\nOther examples of common business investments include ad campaigns and leases\nfor brick-and-mortar retail locations.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 9.828214645385742\nROI: Return on Investment Meaning and Calculation Formulas\n##  What Is Return on Investment or ROI?\nReturn on investment (ROI) is a ratio that measures the profitability of an\ninvestment by comparing the gain or loss to its cost. It helps assess the\npotential return of investments on things like stocks or business ventures.\nROI is usually presented as a percentage and can be calculated using a\nspecific formula.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 9.69793701171875\nWhat Is ROI (Return on Investment) and How is it Calculated?\n## What is ROI?\n\nReturn on investment refers to the amount of profit directly related to an\nexpense or group of expenses. Companies generally use ROI to measure the\nsuccess of a specific project or purchase. If a business owner were to invest\nmoney in an advertising campaign, they\u2019d analyze the sales generated by the ad\nand use that information to determine the ROI. If the money generated exceeded\nthe amount spent, the profit would be referred to as the ROI of the ad\ncampaign.\n\nInvestors also want to know the potential ROI of an investment before\ncommitting any funds to a company. Forecasting a company\u2019s potential ROI is a\nkey factor for investors who, after all, ultimately want to profit from their\ninvestment.\n\n### What is annualized ROI?\n\nAnnualized ROI describes the average yearly return on an investment over a\nperiod of years. This shows how profitable the venture is overall. Annualized\nROI can help you analyze and compare the performance of your investment during\nspecific time periods.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 9.675464630126953\nWhat Is a Good Return on Investment (ROI)? (Plus Formula) | Indeed.com\n## What is ROI?\nReturn on investment (ROI) is a calculation to determine how well an\ninvestment, or group of investments, may perform. Personal investors and\ninvestment firms might use ROI to help make important investment decisions,\nsuch as whether to fund a business venture or purchase stocks.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 9.20722484588623\nROI: Return on Investment Meaning and Calculation Formulas\n## What Is ROI?\n\nReturn on investment, or ROI, is a straightforward measurement of the bottom\nline. How much profit (or loss) did an investment make after considering its\ncosts?  \n\nROI is used for a wide range of business and investing decisions. It can be\nused to calculate the actual returns on an investment, to project the\npotential return on a new investment, or to compare the potential returns on a\nnumber of investment alternatives.  \n\nFor example, if a business owner is considering expanding into a new product\nline, the ROI formula can be used to chart out its costs and estimate its\npotential returns. If an entrepreneur is evaluating a new project, an ROI\ncalculation can help determine if the likely return is worth the expense. If\nan investor is evaluating past or future stock purchases, the ROI formula is a\nquick indicator of real or potential stock performance.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 9.115468978881836\nROI: Return on Investment Meaning and Calculation Formulas\n##  The Bottom Line\nReturn on investment (ROI) is a simple and intuitive metric of the\nprofitability of an investment. There are some limitations to this metric,\nincluding the facts that it does not consider the holding period of an\ninvestment and is not adjusted for risk. Despite these limitations, ROI is a\nkey metric used by business analysts to evaluate and rank investment\nalternatives.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 9.053486824035645\nReturn on investment - Wikipedia\nReturn on investment (ROI) or return on costs (ROC) is a ratio between net\nincome (over a period) and investment (costs resulting from an investment of\nsome resources at a point in time). A high ROI means the investment's gains\ncompare favourably to its cost. As a performance measure, ROI is used to\nevaluate the efficiency of an investment or to compare the efficiencies of\nseveral different investments.[1] In economic terms, it is one way of relating\nprofits to capital invested.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 9.026559829711914\nROI: Return on Investment Meaning and Calculation Formulas\n## How Is Return on Investment (ROI) Used?\n\nROI is a straightforward method of calculating the return on an investment. It\ncan be used to measure profit or loss on a current investment or to evaluate\nthe potential profit or loss of an investment that you are considering making.  \n\nKeep in mind that ROI omits a key factor: the length of time that it took to\nearn that profit (or make that loss). Obviously, a stock that makes a 10%\nreturn in one year is preferable to a stock that makes a 10% return in four\nyears.  \n\nFor this reason, the formula for annualized return on investment may be a\nbetter choice than the basic formula for return on investment. (Both are shown\nabove.)\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 8.919515609741211\nWhat is Return on Investment (ROI)? A Complete Guide | Mailchimp\n* Glossary\n  * Return on Investment (ROI)\n\n#  Return on Investment (ROI)\n\nA calculation of the monetary value of an investment versus its cost. The ROI\nformula is: (profit minus cost) / cost. If you made $10,000 from a $1,000\neffort, your return on investment (ROI) would be 0.9, or 90%. This can be also\nusually obtained through an investment calculator. ROI can be useful to assess\nthe potential profitability of a particular investment, your marketing\ncampaigns (for marketing accountability) or when developing business plans to\nstart your business. Return on ad spend (ROAS) is a similar metric, but it\nfocuses more on specific tactics, such as an individual ad campaign to grow\nyour business.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 8.436944961547852\nROI: Return on Investment Meaning and Calculation Formulas\nDue to its simplicity, ROI has become a standard, universal measure of\nprofitability. As a measurement, it is not likely to be misunderstood or\nmisinterpreted because it has the same connotations in every context.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 8.367259979248047\nWhat Is ROI (Return on Investment) and How is it Calculated?\n## Use return on investment for more effective growth\n\nUnderstanding the ROI of any project or marketing campaign helps in\nidentifying successful business practices. Many companies use ROI to identify\nmethods of marketing and advertising that yield the highest return based on\nprevious successes. This way, ROI becomes not only a measure of past success\nbut also an estimate for the coming months.\n\nROI can be applied to most areas of your business and works as a simple but\neffective method to measure your performance. Using it in combination with\nnon-numerical data, such as employee happiness, can give you some ideas about\nhow to grow your business. With proper ROI use, you can make the most of your\nresources for long-term success.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 8.095351219177246\nROI: Return on Investment Meaning and Calculation Formulas\n### Key Takeaways\n\n  * Return on investment (ROI) is an approximate measure of an investment's profitability.\n  * ROI is calculated by subtracting the initial cost of the investment from its final value, then dividing this new number by the cost of the investment, and finally, multiplying it by 100.\n  * ROI has a wide range of uses. It can be used to measure the profitability of stock shares, to decide whether to purchase a business, or to evaluate the success of a real estate transaction.\n  * One disadvantage of ROI is that it doesn't account for how long an investment is held.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 8.03011417388916\nWhat is Return on Investment (ROI)?

When a company is\nspending money on a piece of equipment, for example, the ROI is in\nproductivity. Meanwhile, marketing spending requires an ROI in sales. The ROI\nyou expect from your search engine optimization efforts will be different from\nthe ROI you look for from an investment in a new factory.\n\nA healthy double-digit ROI is great for starters, and if you identify high-\npercentage ROIs, you should aim to figure out how to amplify and extend those\neffects. Consider carefully whether you get an ROI at all and be realistic\nbefore signing contracts and spending money. Don\u2019t make any big purchases\nright away \u2014 someone promising the moon is likely not going to deliver good\nreturns.\n\nTipTip\n\nMake sure that you properly research any potential investment before you\npurchase it.

One of the most popular, and most effective, whether\nwhen investing capital or implementing a marketing strategy such as PPC\ncampaign, is return on investment (ROI).\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll cover all the basics you need to know about ROI, from\nthe ROI formula calculation, to some tactics you can use to increase your ROI\nas well as the limitations of ROI.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.762887001037598\nReturn on investment - Wikipedia\n## Purpose[edit]\nIn business, the purpose of the return on investment (ROI) metric is to\nmeasure, per period, rates of return on money invested in an economic entity\nin order to decide whether or not to undertake an investment. It is also used\nas an indicator to compare different investments within a portfolio. The\ninvestment with the largest ROI is usually prioritized, even though the spread\nof ROI over the time period of an investment should also be taken into\naccount. Recently, the concept has also been applied to scientific funding\nagencies\u2019 (e.g., National Science Foundation) investments in research of open\nsource hardware and subsequent returns for direct digital replication.[2]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.712815761566162\nReturn on investment - Wikipedia\nROI is a popular metric for heads of marketing because of marketing budget\nallocation. Return on Investment helps identify marketing mix activities that\nshould continue to be funded and which should be cut.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.579366683959961\nWhat Is ROI (Return on Investment) and How is it Calculated?\n### Table of Contents\n\nOpen row\nIn business, few concepts are as important as return on investment (ROI). The\nadage that \u201cyou have to spend money to make money\u201d is often true, but only if\nyou\u2019ve anticipated the ROI potential of your investments. Whether you\u2019re\nimplementing new business software or aggressively investing in a marketing\ncampaign, the ultimate goal is to make more money. Understanding how to\ncalculate ROI can help you understand which investments are paying off and\nwhich costs should simply be cut.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.4463653564453125\nWhat Is ROI (Return on Investment) and How is it Calculated?\n## Benefits of calculating ROI\n\nUnderstanding your profits and the impact of an investment on your business is\nimportant and extremely helpful when making decisions for your company.\n\nHere are two more benefits that calculating your return on investment\nprovides:\n\n  1. Calculating ROI allows business owners to track and analyze short- and long-term projects: \u201cYou can set simple targets for both short-term and long-term goals, and ROI can measure if you are achieving those benchmarks quickly and easily,\u201d Gauvreau said. \n  2. Determining ROI helps you evaluate your business\u2019s financial performance: Knowing your ROI keeps your company on track by demonstrating whether your business is profiting above or below its average, said Leonard Ang, real estate agent and CEO of iProperty Management. It\u2019s a good reminder for companies to maintain a standard for their finances.\n  3. ROI is one of the simplest performance metrics to calculate: All ROI does is measure the cost of an investment vs. the revenue that investment yields. It\u2019s a universally accepted financial metric because it\u2019s easy for anyone to understand and translates directly to how much money you\u2019ve made from a given expense. \n  4. Knowing ROI can help you better understand the impact each department is having on your profits: Since ROI is so simple to calculate, it\u2019s one of the easiest ways to compare the performance of departments within your company. Comparing a department\u2019s ROI this year to its past ROI can help you understand how efficiently it\u2019s performing. \n\nTipTip\n\nRemember, not every department should necessarily be delivering an ROI. While\nyour sales team should ideally be generating a large ROI, your human resources\ndepartment likely will not even though it serves a critical function. Consider\nthe context when using ROI to determine the performance of departments.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.406282424926758\nROI: Return on Investment Meaning and Calculation Formulas\nAn investor who is targeting a portfolio return of 12%, for example, would\nhave to assume a substantially higher degree of risk than an investor whose\ngoal is a return of 4%. If that investor hones in on the ROI number without\nalso evaluating the associated risk, the eventual outcome may be very\ndifferent from the expected result.\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",

Joan Crawford as Mildred Pierce\n\nEverett Collection\n\nMildred Pierce (1945), directed by Michael Curtiz\n\nIs Mildred Pierce a film noir? A women's picture? Yes, and yes. But it's also\na masochistic march through the stations of the cross for Joan Crawford's\nstoic hero as she suffers through a failed first marriage, a playboy second\nhusband, and a spoiled ingrate daughter from hell. Viewed through our 21st-\ncentury lens, Crawford's performance (those shoulder pads!) can seem like it's\nteetering on the edge of camp. After all, it's hard to watch her and not see\nthe long shadow cast by Mommie Dearest. But for its time, Mildred Pierce's\nself-made brand of feminism was undeniably revolutionary. Crawford was always\nan underrated actress, but there's something about playing such an\nunderestimated up-by-her-bootstraps woman in Michael Curtiz's film that\nliberates her to be better than she ever was before and better than she ever\nwould be again. \u2014Chris Nashawaty\n\nJoan Crawford: Still relevant\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.14702469110488892\n'Everything Everywhere All At Once' wins best picture at 2023 Oscars\nBrendan Fraser bested Austin Butler for best actor, which wasn\u2019t exactly an\nupset as they were both leading contenders.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.26249760389328003\nThe 25 greatest Best Actress winners in Oscar history\nend: comp mntl-sc-list-item list-sc-item mntl-block\nend: comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\n##  17\\.

Rob Corddry, Queen Latifah, Dennis Miller, and Zach Galifianakis, among\nothers, provide solid laughs whenever the film slows down. Director Tom\nVaughan keeps the pace brisk, and that swiftness keeps What Happens in Vegas\nfrom bogging down or becoming a chore.

So how do you top a\nindestructible killing machine built like Arnold Schwarzenegger? Give it an\nupgrade! Robert Patrick took playing a soulless silver goo monster to new\nheights as James Cameron\u2019s big bad in \u201cTerminator 2: Judgement Day.\u201d Patrick\u2019s\ndead-faced performance (\u201cHave you seen this boy\u201d), coupled with Cameron\u2019s\ndrive to push FX technology way beyond the scope of what our tiny 1991 brains\nthought was possible gave audiences cinematic moments that have been parodied,\ncopied but (to this day) never topped. Only a film this perfect could make a\ncharacter made entirely out of the laughably named \u201cmimetic polyalloy\u201d\nsubstance as frightening as the \u201cJaws\u201d shark.\n\nThis movie also started the rise of the Linda Hamilton hive. John Connor might\nbe the legacy the Terminator franchise must protect at all costs, but without\nSarah Connor there is no John. Re-introduced doing pull-ups in an insane\nasylum, this was the character pivot audiences were craving. Hamilton\u2019s\nportrayal of the no-nonsense prepper is perfection. Many after her would try\nto recreate this genius glare; all would fail.\n\nRead Variety\u2018s original review here.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.507808208465576\nThe Best Movie Sequels of All Time: 'Avatar 2,' 'Creed' and More\n/#main-wrapper\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.367682933807373\nThe Best Movie Sequels of All Time: 'Avatar 2,' 'Creed' and More\n1.

With bleakly beautiful scenes shot by Roger Deakins, the sequel\nmay be long but offers plenty of food for thought in the story of Officer K,\nplayed by Ryan Gosling, a new LAPD blade runner who goes on a quest to find\nRick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a blade runner who went missing decades ago.\n\nRead Variety\u2018s original review here.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.4782915115356445\nThe Best Movie Sequels of All Time: 'Avatar 2,' 'Creed' and More\n* ## Evil Dead II\n\nImage Credit: \u00a9Rialto Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nAfter the microbudget success of \u201cEvil Dead,\u201d writer/director Sam Raimi and\nstar Bruce Campbell were given 10 times as much money to make a sequel, but it\nhad to follow similar beats to the first film. What to do? Remake it with more\ngore, \u201cThree Stooges\u201d-inspired laughs and manaical setpieces, and hope to\nstrike gold. This enhanced 1987 vision elevated the material into a franchise\nthat spawned comic books, films, a TV series and a new chapter \u2014 \u201cEvil Dead\nRise\u201d \u2014 slated to hit theaters in 2023. It was all built out of some sadistic\nand goofy demons in a cabin.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.241032361984253\nThe Best Movie Sequels of All Time: 'Avatar 2,' 'Creed' and More\n##  Sign Up for Variety Newsletters\n\nYour Email\n\nSign Up  Sign Up\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy\nPolicy.

Some of the hilarious highlights include some awkward slam poetry, a\ndrug trip gone wrong and a meltdown from Ice Cube\u2019s police captain when he\nrealizes his daughter is sleeping with Hill\u2019s character Schmidt. Sadly, more\nplanned sequels and spinoffs didn\u2019t come to fruition, but \u201c22 Jump Street\u201d\nhelped directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller become sure-fire hitmakers.\n\nRead Variety\u2018s original review here.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.0346741676330566\nThe Best Movie Sequels of All Time: 'Avatar 2,' 'Creed' and More\n* ## The Godfather Part II\n\nImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola outdoes his original gangster epic, dramatically\nexpanding its scope into a more shadowed, complex economy of tycoons. The\nstructural gambit of dual timelines, cutting between Michael\u2019s (Al Pacino)\nefforts to reconfigure his criminal empire to more legitimate business\ninvestments and his father\u2019s (Robert De Niro) immigration to America and ties\nto his community, deepens the sense of tragedy. As one man works to protect\nhis family, his son obliterates his own.\n\nRead Variety\u2018s original review here.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.0216875076293945\nThe Best Movie Sequels of All Time: 'Avatar 2,' 'Creed' and More\n* ## The Devil's Rejects\n\nImage Credit: \u00a9Lions Gate/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nRob Zombie\u2019s directorial debut \u201cHouse of 1,000 Corpses\u201d may have its fans, but\nnothing will ever top his gleefully transgressive sequel, \u201cThe Devil\u2019s\nRejects,\u201d in terms of sheer savagery. The story of a family of depraved\npsychopaths cutting a bloody swath across Texas, the film perfectly\nencapsulates all of Zombie\u2019s genre obsessions. Overflowing with degradation,\ntorture, mutilation and murder, \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Rejects\u201d is, nevertheless, quite\nfunny at times. That mix of brutality and humor is tricky to pull off when the\nmaterial is as extreme as this, but Zombie threads the needle\u2026 after stabbing\nit through a few eyeballs, of course.\n\nRead Variety\u2018s original review here.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.9706434607505798\nThe Best Movie Sequels of All Time: 'Avatar 2,' 'Creed' and More\ndo not apply CSS styles to this element!\nGetting a sequel to a hit movie right can be a tricky process. Do it right,\nand you\u2019re best picture winner \u201cThe Godfather Part II.\u201d Do it wrong and well,\nhello \u201cSpace Jam: Legacy.\u201d But as sequels and remakes have come to dominate\nmovie theaters, it\u2019s clear that making a successful sequel means more than\njust slapping a \u201c2\u201d on a beloved property \u2014 it takes a good script, hopefully\nmany of the original actors and just maybe, a few new twists on the material.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that much of this list comes from the past 30 years \u2013\nprevious to that, sequels weren\u2019t as ubiquitous on movie screens. However,\ndon\u2019t sleep on some of the more vintage titles like \u201cPink Panther\u201d sequel \u201cA\nShot in the Dark,\u201d comedy classic \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation\u201d or\nthe oldest entry, \u201cThe Bride of Frankstein.\u201d While most of the titles below\nbelong to franchises like \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cAvengers,\u201d there are also a few\nindie outliers \u2014 because why should major studios have all the fun with\nfollow-ups?\n\nHere is Variety\u2018s guide to some of the very best movie sequels of all time.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.919429361820221\nThe Best Movie Sequels of All Time: 'Avatar 2,' 'Creed' and More\n* ## Gremlins 2: The New Batch\n\nImage Credit: \u00a9Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nIf you thought the first \u201dGremlins\u201d got too crazy, then watch out for\n\u201cGremlins 2: The New Batch.\u201d This movie has a smart Gremlin that belts out\nFrank Sinatra classics. There\u2019s a Gremlin with wings that gets covered in\nconcrete and turns into a gargoyle. There\u2019s an electric Gremlin that kills\neverything it touches. There\u2019s a lady Gremlin that just wants to smooch.\nThere\u2019s a spider Gremlin. There\u2019s a really stupid Gremlin. All of these\nGremlins wreak havoc in a mega-conglomerate\u2019s New York skyscraper that has a\ndifferent business on each floor.\n\nRead Variety\u2018s original review here.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.8383384943008423\nThe Best Movie Sequels of All Time: 'Avatar 2,' 'Creed' and More\n* ## A Shot in the Dark\n\nImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nIn Blake Edwards\u2019 cheeky 1963 comedy \u201cThe Pink Panther,\u201d Peter Sellers shared\ntop billing with co-stars David Niven and Robert Wagner, but he wisely took\ncenter stage in the brilliantly funny sequel, \u201cA Shot in the Dark,\u201d which was\nreleased the following year. From the outrageous slapstick gags to the silly\nplot twists to Sellers\u2019 exaggerated French accent, everything about the sequel\nis bigger, brighter and far more entertaining than the original. \u201cA Shot in\nthe Dark\u201d also introduced memorable characters like Commissioner Dreyfus and\nCato (played by Herbert Lom and Burt Kwouk) who went on to become Panther\nmainstays.\n\nRead Variety\u2018s original review here.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.7789164781570435\nThe Best Movie Sequels of All Time: 'Avatar 2,' 'Creed' and More\n* ## The Bride of Frankenstein\n\nImage Credit: Courtesy of Lumiere Festival\n\n  \nAlong with Tod Browning\u2019s \u201cDracula,\u201d James Whale\u2019s horror classic\n\u201cFrankenstein\u201d helped usher in Universal Studios\u2019 revered monster movies that\nlasted from 1931 until 1956. Comprised of more than 40 titles, many of them\nsequels, no entry in the series is more venerated today than Whale\u2019s 1935\nfollow-up, \u201cThe Bride of Frankenstein.\u201d Culminating in one of the creepiest\nmarriage proposals in cinema history, this timeless film is aided immeasurably\nby Elsa Lanchester\u2019s dual role as author Mary Shelley and the Monster\u2019s iconic\nBride. Award-winning makeup artist Jack Pierce collaborated with Whale on her\ngothic appearance.\n\nRead Variety\u2018s original review here.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.7592999935150146\nThe Best Movie Sequels of All Time: 'Avatar 2,' 'Creed' and More\n* ## Thor: Ragnarok\n\nImage Credit: \u00a9Walt Disney Co./courtesy Everett / Everett Collection\n\nDirector Taika Waititi reinvented Chris Hemsworth\u2019s Norse hero after Thor\u2019s\nfirst two movies were more Midgard-sized movies than Asgardian astonishments.\nIn \u201cRagnarok,\u201d Thor has a zanier sense of humor, a new haircut and has to stop\nboth the end of the world and Cate Blanchett\u2019s fearsome villain Hela without\nhis powerful hammer Mjolnir. The supporting cast, like Mark Ruffalo\u2019s Hulk,\nTessa Thompson\u2019s Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum\u2019s Grandmaster, nearly stole the\nshow. \u201cRagnarok\u201d ended up being such a hit that Waititi returned to direct the\nfollow-up, \u201cThor: Love and Thunder,\u201d in 2022.\n\nRead Variety\u2018s original review here.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.5775035619735718\nThe Best Movie Sequels of All Time: 'Avatar 2,' 'Creed' and More\n* ## Incredibles 2\n\nImage Credit: \u00a9Walt Disney Co./courtesy Everett / Everett Collection\n\nThough it took 14 years for the sequel to come to fruition, \u201cIncredibles 2\u201d\nwas worth the wait. Picking up right after the Parr family defeated Syndrome,\nthe Brad Bird-directed film follows the gifted clan as they embark on a new\nmission to restore the public\u2019s trust in superheroes. Grossing $1 billion\nworldwide, the film was a hit at the box office and with critics alike. Though\nVariety\u2019s Owen Gleiberman wrote in his review that it didn\u2019t quite live up to\nthe first installment, it\u2019s still \u201cperfectly snappy and chucklesome and\nheartfelt entertainment.\u201d\n\nRead Variety\u2018s original review here.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.5456866025924683\nThe Best Movie Sequels of All Time: 'Avatar 2,' 'Creed' and More\n* ## Ocean's Twelve\n\nImage Credit: \u00a9Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nIs the coolest heist crew ever assembled still the coolest heist crew ever\nassembled after they are pushed around by a petty mobster, arrested by Italian\npolice and embarrassed by the French? Well, yes. Steven Soderbergh\u2019s follow-up\nwas derided upon release for losing the clockwork precision of its\npredecessor, but the more lackadaisical hangout vibe offers its own bounty of\npleasures, including an unpredictable sense of humor and swoony formal\nflourishes to match the backdrop of Euro luxury. The film imagines a world\nsolely occupied by hyper skilled aristocrats and their wounded egos, and it\nknows just how funny that world is.\n\nRead Variety\u2018s original review here.\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",

In\nfact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP,\nstocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3%\nannual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.\n\nVisit the Earnings ESP Center\n\nSee the Full List of Stocks To Beat Earnings\n\n    0.00%\n\nMost Accurate Est\n\n    -0.22\n\nCurrent Qtr Est\n\n    -0.22\n\nCurrent Yr Est\n\n    -0.38\n\nExp Earnings Date\n\nMore Info\n\nThis is an estimated date of earnings release.

This\ndedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our\nproven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the\nS&P 500 with an average gain of +24.18% per year. These returns cover a period\nfrom January 1, 1988 through January 1, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system\nreturns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of\nthe month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that\nparticular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank\nstocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are\nthen compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks\nincluded in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are\nincluded in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do,\nchange throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end\nprice was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain\nother reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may\nlicense the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties,\nincluding but not limited to the issuer.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.1266655921936035\nKrystal Biotech - KRYS - Stock Price Today - Zacks\nRank Blocks\nZacks rank\nZacks Rank:\n\nMore Info\n\nThis is our short term rating system that serves as a timeliness indicator for\nstocks over the next 1 to 3 months.

The movie takes place in the fictional island village\nof Smeerensburg, where spoiled young postman Jesper (voiced by Jason\nSchwartzman) strikes up an unlikely friendship with a local carpenter/toymaker\nnamed Klaus (J.K. Simmons). The whole town is involved in a generations-old\nfeud between two families/factions that leads to lots of resentment and\ntreating fellow villagers as \"the enemy.\" Expect lots of sight gags, plenty of\nphysical comedy, and some peril, as well as some mob scenes of village folk\narmed and ready to fight. There's some romance (flirting, kissing, and\nmarriage); language includes mild insults like \"loser,\" \"brat,\" and \"idiot,\"\nas well as \"what the ... ?\" A few characters speak in the S\u00e1mi language --\ntheir lines are subtitled. The story promotes moving past old grudges and\ncelebrates the joy of children who want to have friends and to play. Parents\nand kids will be able to discuss the importance of generosity, compassion, and\nteamwork in the movie.

Klaus's take on the Santa origin story is\nunique and a little loopy, but as Jesper and Klaus collaborate to bring toys\nto the children of Smeerensburg, the movie manages to explain all of the key\npoints of the Santa legend (the reindeer, the sled, the chimney, the big bag\nof toys, even the bright red outfit). The snowy landscapes are gorgeously\nanimated -- swirling shades of white, blue, brown, and red -- while the\ncharacters are crisp and expressive. On one side, there's the perpetually\nscowling matriarch of the Krum family (Joan Cusack), and on the other, there's\nthe adorable S\u00e1mi girl who ends up enlisting her entire tribe to assist Jesper\nand Klaus in his workshop.\n\nThe initial premise -- that Jesper just wants the kids' postage-paid letters\nand the return toys delivered so that he can get out of Smeerensburg -- isn't\nnearly as important as the ensuing friendships between both Jesper and Klaus\nand Jesper and Alva, who's finally able to go back to teaching once the kids\nrealize they need to learn to write to send Klaus letters. Jesper's character\ndevelopment is crucial in recognizing the story's holiday spirit. Giving to\nthe kids isn't a means to an end at all. The giving is what brings meaning to\nKlaus, to him, and eventually to the entire town. Sweeter and more thoughtful\nthan it needed to be, this is a fine holiday pick for the family.\n\nShow more\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.447243332862854\nKlaus Movie Review | Common Sense Media\n## What's the Story?\n\nKLAUS follows Jesper (voiced by Jason Schwartzman), a privileged young Postal\nAcademy employee whose strict father, the Postmaster General, punishes him\nwith the most remote assignment possible: Smeerensburg, an island above the\nArctic Circle. Jesper can't return to his pampered life at home until he\nprocesses 6,000 pieces of mail in one year. But upon arriving in Smeerensburg,\nit becomes clear that the citizens aren't inclined to send correspondence: The\ntown is built on resentment and recrimination, and the founding families are\nengaged in a War of the Roses-style feud. Even the town's one teacher, Alva\n(Rashida Jones), has turned into a fishmonger because the warring factions\ndon't send their kids to school to sit next to the enemy. After Jesper\naccidentally delivers a child's letter to village hermit Klaus (J.K. Simmons),\na carpenter and toymaker, Klaus asks Jesper to deliver a toy back to the\nchild. This gives Jesper a brilliant idea: Every kid who writes Klaus a letter\nshould get a toy in response; that way, all the eager kids' letters will\neventually add up to his father's quota.\n\nShow more\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.22967223823070526\nKlaus (2019) \u2b50 8.2 | Animation, Adventure, Comedy\nBack to top\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.247879296541214\nKlaus (2019) \u2b50 8.2 | Animation, Adventure, Comedy\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\nSign in\n\n\n### FAQ16\n\n  * How long is Klaus?Powered by Alexa\n### Details\n\nEdit\n\n  * Release date\n\n    * November 15, 2019 (United States)\n\n  * Countries of origin\n\n    * Spain\n    * United Kingdom\n    * United States\n\n  * Official site\n\n    * Production studios website\n\n  * Languages\n\n    * English\n    * Saami\n\n  * Also known as\n\n    * Klaus - C\u00e2u Chuy\u1ec7n Gi\u00e1ng Sinh\n\n  * Production companies\n\n    * The SPA Studios\n    * Atresmedia Cine\n    * Netflix Animation\n\n  * See more company credits at IMDbPro\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.43793171644210815\nKlaus (2019) \u2b50 8.2 | Animation, Adventure, Comedy\nTop rated movie #174\n\n  * Nominated for 1 Oscar\n\n    * 11 wins & 26 nominations total\n### Videos19\n\nTrailer 2:35\n\nWatch Official Trailer\n\nTrailer 2:37\n\nWatch Klaus\n\nClip 2:12\n\nWatch 10 Top-Rated Holiday Classics to Stream Now\n\nClip 1:35\n\nWatch Memorable Moments From New Holiday Classics\n\nClip 2:07\n\nWatch Klaus: Flying Sleigh\n\nClip 2:38\n\nWatch Klaus: Invisible (Lyric Video)\n\nClip 1:51\n\nWatch Klaus: Christmas Deliveries\n\nClip 1:48\n\nWatch Klaus: Klaus' Workshop\n\nClip 0:46\n\nWatch Klaus: Family Feuds\n\nClip 1:13\n\nWatch Klaus: Jesper's Proposition\n\nClip 1:00\n\nWatch Klaus: Delivering Presents\n\nClip 0:54\n\nWatch Klaus: Jesper Pitches Christmas\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.5683270692825317\nKlaus (2019) \u2b50 8.2 | Animation, Adventure, Comedy\n### Related news\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n  * IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n  * Learn more about contributing\n\nEdit page\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.6715830564498901\nKlaus Movie Review | Common Sense Media\n* ### Positive Role Models\n\nsome\n\nJesper starts off as a \"spoiled brat\" but ends up a kind, generous man who\nappreciates the kids of Smeerensburg and his friendship with Klaus.

Collodi, it chronicles the adventures of a wooden\npuppet whose lonely maker, Geppetto, wishes were a real boy. A fairy grants\nhis wish by bringing the puppet, Pinocchio, to life, but she tells Pinocchio\nthat he must prove his worth before she will make him into a human boy. Under\nthe guidance of his insect friend, Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio experiences a\nseries of incredible adventures on his way to becoming a real boy. He is\ndeterred from deceit in his new life by his nose, which grows longer every\ntime he tells a lie.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nClassic Closing Lines\n\nThe outstanding animation techniques employed in the earlier Disney classic\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) are even more impressive in Pinocchio.\nThe movie is also noteworthy in its storytelling, which is in turn humorous,\ntragic, and suspenseful. The sequence inside the whale\u2014in which Pinocchio\nrescues Geppetto, who was swallowed by the giant mammal\u2014is one of the seminal\nDisney screen moments. Another highlight of the film is the music, notably the\nsong \u201cWhen You Wish upon a Star,\u201d which became a Disney classic. Most of the\ngreat artists who performed the voice-over work did not receive screen credit\nor recognition until many years later, when their efforts were acknowledged in\nspecial-edition documentaries for the home video market.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.513885498046875\nWhy 1940's 'Pinocchio' Is Still Disney\u2019s Most Terrifying Movie\nNo winning ad found for zone: every image repeatable!\nNo winning ad found for zone: word count repeatable!\nNo winning ad found for zone: every entry repeatable!\nDisney continues its string of live-action remakes with Robert Zemeckis\u2019\nPinocchio, set to be released on Disney+ September 8th.

He moved to Paris in 1906 and\nsettled at the Bateau-Lavoir, an artists\u2019 dwelling where his compatriot Pablo\nPicasso lived. Gris was thus in touch with the evolution of Cubism, a style\ninitiated by Picasso and Georges Braque around 1907. Gris executed his first\nserious paintings in 1910 and adopted the Cubist style the following year. In\n1912 the prominent art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler agreed to purchase his\nentire artistic output.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nUltimate Art Quiz\n\nThe Breakfast Table, oil and charcoal on canvas by Juan Gris, 1915; in the\nNational Museum of Modern Art, Paris.\n\nIn 1912 Picasso and Braque abandoned their abstract analyses of form and began\nto synthesize images from found shapes and textures, a style that is referred\nto as Synthetic Cubism. The following year Gris arrived at his own personal\nand mature version of Synthetic Cubism. His works are characterized by\nrigorously geometric compositions in which fragmented objects and sharp-edged\nplanes are articulated with maximum clarity. A more theoretical painter than\nPicasso or Braque, Gris systematized their discoveries, making their\nintuitions comprehensible and, consequently, helping to spread the Cubist\nstyle. His version of Cubism was more severe and classical, and less\nspontaneous, than theirs. Between 1921 and 1927, however, Gris transformed his\nSynthetic Cubist idiom so that his style became increasingly free and lyrical.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.508272647857666\nJuan Gris Paintings, Bio, Ideas | TheArtStory\n### Mature Period\nThough many recognized his talent in its own right, his work followed the\naustere monochromatic style of Analytic Cubism in the early 1910s, and moved\nin the direction of Synthetic Cubism \\- a subsequent phase, distinguished by a\nbroader, bolder use of color and a collage-like approach to composition - from\n1914 onward.

More somber in tone than many of his\npreceding works in the Synthetic Cubist mode, and simpler, limited to a figure\nand some objects arranged in two distinct planes, his representation of a\nfarmer expresses a nostalgic mood and a yearning for an enduring, traditional\nway of life in a chaotic and uncertain time.\n\nOil on Canvas - Pompidou Centre, Paris\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.291193425655365\nJuan Gris Paintings, Bio, Ideas | TheArtStory\n### Early Training\nAfter leaving school, he studied painting under the tutelage of Jos\u00e9 Moreno\nCarbonero, a respected and sucessful artist in Madrid who had himself taught\nSalvador Dal\u00ed and Picasso.

The causes of the Great Depression were many and varied,\nbut the impact was visible across the country. By the time that FDR was\ninaugurated president on March 4, 1933, the banking system had collapsed,\nnearly 25% of the labor force was unemployed, and prices and productivity had\nfallen to 1/3 of their 1929 levels. Reduced prices and reduced output resulted\nin lower incomes in wages, rents, dividends, and profits throughout the\neconomy. Factories were shut down, farms and homes were lost to foreclosure,\nmills and mines were abandoned, and people went hungry. The resulting lower\nincomes meant the further inability of the people to spend or to save their\nway out of the crisis, thus perpetuating the economic slowdown in a seemingly\nnever-ending cycle.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 8.344240188598633\nGreat Depression | Definition, History, Dates, Causes, Effects, ...\n[BEFORE-ARTICLE]\nGreat Depression, worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929 and lasted\nuntil about 1939.

The downturn became markedly worse, however, in late 1929\nand continued until early 1933. Real output and prices fell precipitously.\nBetween the peak and the trough of the downturn, industrial production in the\nUnited States declined 47 percent and real gross domestic product (GDP) fell\n30 percent. The wholesale price index declined 33 percent (such declines in\nthe price level are referred to as deflation). Although there is some debate\nabout the reliability of the statistics, it is widely agreed that the\nunemployment rate exceeded 20 percent at its highest point. The severity of\nthe Great Depression in the United States becomes especially clear when it is\ncompared with America\u2019s next worst recession, the Great Recession of 2007\u201309,\nduring which the country\u2019s real GDP declined just 4.3 percent and the\nunemployment rate peaked at less than 10 percent.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.481876373291016\nGreat Depression Facts - FDR Presidential Library & Museum\nMore Information on the Great Depression:  \nThe beginning ofAmerica's \"Great Depression\" is often cited as the dramatic\ncrash of the stock market on \"Black Thursday,\" October 24, 1929 when 16\nmillion shares of stock were quickly sold by panicking investors who had lost\nfaith in the American economy.

However, the stock market collapse did not cause\nthe depression; nor can it explain the extraordinary length and depth of the\nAmerican contraction. In most countries, such as Britain, France, Canada, the\nNetherlands, and the Nordic countries, the depression was less severe and\nshorter, often ending by 1931. Those countries did not have the banking and\nfinancial crises that the United States did, and most left the gold standard\nearlier than the United States did. In the United States, in contrast, the\ncontraction continued for four years from the summer of 1929 through the first\nquarter of 1933. During that time real GNP fell 30.5 percent, wholesale prices\nfell 30.8 percent, and consumer prices fell 24.4 percent.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.706045150756836\nGreat Depression Facts - FDR Presidential Library & Museum\nAt the height of the Depression in 1933, 24.9% of the nation's total work\nforce, 12,830,000 people, were unemployed. Wage income for workers who were\nlucky enough to have kept their jobs fell 42.5% between 1929 and 1933.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.644972324371338\nMilestones: 1921\u20131936 - Office of the Historian\nDorothea Lange\u2019s Migrant Mother\nThe origins of the Great Depression were complicated and have been much\ndebated among scholars. The initial factor was the First World War, which\nupset international balances of power and caused a dramatic shock to the\nglobal financial system. The gold standard, which had long served as the basis\nfor national currencies and their exchange rates, had to be temporarily\nsuspended in order to recover from the costs of the Great War, but the United\nStates, European nations, and Japan put forth great effort to reestablish it\nby the end of the decade. However, this introduced inflexibility into domestic\nand international financial markets, which meant that they were less able to\ndeal with additional shocks when they came in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\nThe U.S. stock market crash of 1929, an economic downturn in Germany, and\nfinancial difficulties in France and Great Britain all coincided to cause a\nglobal financial crisis. Dedication to the gold standard in each of these\nnations and Japan, which only managed to return to it in 1930, only made the\nproblem worse and hastened the slide into what is now known as the Great\nDepression.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.48854923248291\nGreat Depression - Econlib\nFriedman, Milton, and Anna Jacobson Schwartz.

Only a thorough analysis of a company's\nfundamentals can do that. Shares are often over- or undervalued by the market,\nmeaning the market price determines only how much the market is willing to pay\nfor its shares.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.42329853773117065\nMarket Capitalization & the P/E Ratio | Finance - Zacks\n## Basics\n\nMarket capitalization is the product of share price and the number of\noutstanding shares. For example, if a company has 1 million shares outstanding\nand its stock is trading at $20, its market cap is $20 million. P/E ratio is\nthe ratio of share price to net income or earnings, which is what remains from\nrevenues after paying all expenses and dividends to preferred shareholders. In\nthe example, if the company earns $2 per share, the P/E ratio is $20 divided\nby $2, or 10. The P/E ratio is also the market cap divided by the total annual\nearnings, which gives you the same result.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.17684651911258698\nMarket Capitalization: What It Means for Investors\n> Market Cap = Current Share Price * Total Number of Shares Outstanding\nA company with 20 million shares selling at $100 a share has a market cap of\n$2 billion.

The first of the new tracks\nis \"Party for Two\". Twain recorded it as a duet with Sugar Ray lead singer\nMark McGrath and country musician Billy Currington. The song is lyrically\nabout Twain enticing a guy to come to a party, which he's at first hesitant\nbut when Twain shows it's just for the two of them he decides to join. The pop\nmix featuring McGrath was released to pop, adult contemporary, and\ninternational markets; likewise, the country version featuring Currington was\nreleased to country radio. The country version was not included in the\nEuropean version of Greatest Hits but was included as a b-side on the CD\nsingle of \"Party for Two\". The second song included on the compilation is the\nadult contemporary influenced country ballad \"Don't!\". \"Don't!\" lyrically\ninvolves Twain wishing a partner for forgiveness. The third and final song\nincluded on Greatest Hits is the pure-country \"I Ain't No Quitter\". The song\nlyrically speaks of Twain sticking with an overconfident and brassy man\nbecause she is not \"a quitter\".\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",

The international governing body for volleyball is the Federation Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB), headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland. The FIVB is the world's largest sports federation, with more than 200 member nations. Under the direction of its president, the FIVB oversees the administration of volleyball throughout the world and is responsible for producing several major events, including the Olympic Games, World Championships, World Cup, World League and World Grand Prix. The FIVB's main activity is worldwide planning and organisation of volleyball events, sometimes in conjunction with other international governing bodies such as the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The FIVB also maintains extensive special programmes aimed at the advance of world volleyball. This includes the constitution of development centers in areas where the sport is still unpopular, as well as support (in instruction and equipment) for organizations that fail to meet the quality standards required on an international level. Another relevant area of concern is the promotion of volleyball in a worldwide scale. Part of the FIVB's activities in this area consists in attracting media partners and sponsors through negotiation of commercial rights for broadcasting and coverage of major events.The FIVB Working closely with national federations and private enterprises the FIVB aims to develop Volleyball as a major world media and entertainment sport through world-class planning and organisation of competitions, marketing and development activities. As the global guiding organisation for volleyball, the FIVB upholds the highest standards to ensure the legacy and excellence of the sport is experienced and enjoyed around the world. The FIVB\u2019s key role is to provide leadership to over 500 million players and 33 million licensed athletes.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.09307049959897995\nVolleyball | Definition, History, Rules, Positions, Court, & Facts ...\n[P3]\n[AM3]\n[MOD3]\nVolleyball was introduced into Europe by American troops during World War I,\nwhen national organizations were formed.

In August, Radiohead released two singles from these sessions on\ntheir website: \"These Are My Twisted Words\", and \"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)\",\na tribute to Harry Patch, the last surviving British soldier to have fought in\nthe First World War, with proceeds donated to the British Legion. Yorke had\nsuggested Radiohead might move away from the traditional album format, instead\nreleasing singles or EPs, but as work continued into 2010,an eighth long-play\nrecord became the focus.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.568119525909424\nThe Best Radiohead Songs: All 158 Tracks, Ranked\nBut a line has to be drawn somewhere: no side projects, solo releases, or\nremixes, and no songs the band has performed live but not put on a proper\nrecord (including \u201cSpooks,\u201d a 2006 instrumental that found its way, in non-\nRadiohead form, onto the Inherent Vice soundtrack). Finally, when a band\u2019s\nallure is partly the type of enigmatic elegance that earned Yorke his\nmillions, it\u2019s only natural that people will disagree. So as Radiohead\nthemselves once put it: I might be wrong.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.534533977508545\nThe Best Radiohead Songs: All 158 Tracks, Ranked\nThe trailblazing U.K. quintet\u2019s more recent activity has been just as\nfascinating: Their ninth studio album, A Moon Shaped Pool, was released in\n2016. In the years before that, Yorke has brooded as a glitchy electronic solo\nartist when not shaking his ponytail as a member of the rhythm-centered Atoms\nfor Peace supergroup; multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood has roamed from\nscoring Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s film Inherent Vice to recording with\ntraditional musicians in India; and drummer Phil Selway has devised his own\nsinger/songwriter miniatures. But on A Moon Shaped Pool, that sense of the\nhalf-understood sublime, conveyed most powerfully through Yorke\u2019s fragile\nupper register and foreboding keys, remained undimmed. Radiohead\u2019s still doing\nit.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.5169320106506348\nThe Best Radiohead Songs: All 158 Tracks, Ranked\n34\\. \u201cVideotape,\u201d In Rainbows  \nNever mind the Mephistopheles allusion, a signpost of rock pretentiousness\nsince Sting first had Police fans wrapped around his finger. This deeply\nmoving song is another of Radiohead\u2019s knockout album closers, and its vision\nof a dying farewell through videotape is a nifty corollary to \u201cA Reminder\u201d and\nits idea of a song to play someone over the phone anytime they need it. \u201cNo\nmatter what happens now,\u201d Yorke promises, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.501636028289795\nRadiohead | Rock Music Wiki | Fandom\nRadiohead's seventh album, In Rainbows, was released through the band's own\nwebsite in October 2007 as a digital download for which customers could make\nwhatever payment that they deemed appropriate (pay what you want), including\npaying nothing at all; the site only advised, \"it's up to you\". Following the\nband's sudden announcement 10 days beforehand, Radiohead's unusual strategy\nreceived much notice within the music industry and beyond. 1.2 million\ndownloads were reportedly sold by the day of release, but the band's\nmanagement did not release official sales figures, claiming that the Internet-\nonly distribution was intended to boost later retail sales. In a 2011\nappearance on The Colbert Report, Ed O'Brien said of the self-release\nstrategy: \"We sell less records, but we make more money.\" Colin Greenwood\nexplained the Internet release as a way of avoiding the \"regulated playlists\"\nand \"straitened formats\" of radio and TV, ensuring fans around the world could\nall experience the music at the same time, and preventing leaks in advance of\na physical release. A \"discbox\", including a second disc from the recording\nsessions, vinyl and CD editions of the album, and a hardcover book of artwork,\nwas also sold and shipped in late 2007.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.445446014404297\nList of songs recorded by Radiohead - Wikipedia\n\"Up on the Ladder\"  | In Rainbows Disk 2 | Nigel Godrich  | 2007  | [36]\n\"Vegetable\"  | Pablo Honey | Sean Slade  \nPaul Q.

Thom\nYorke\u2019s high, lonesome vocals join with a desolate piano and are accompanied\nby the ambient noises of, according to lore, his partner Rachel Owen in the\nkitchen. Yorke\u2019s words are almost beyond comprehension, but the feeling behind\nthem is palpable. The resulting track is too incomplete-sounding, and\ndefinitely too obscure, to meaningfully consider as one of Radiohead\u2019s major\nworks. But it\u2019s a perfect example of how the band\u2019s front man can summon up\ncryptic beauty as if doing so were as ordinary as chopping up vegetables.

Tickets were auctioned, raising over\nhalf a million US dollars for the NGO's 2010 Haiti earthquake relief. In\nDecember, a fan-made video of the performance was released via YouTube and\ntorrent with the band's support and a \"pay-what-you-want\" link to donate to\nOxfam. In September 2010, Radiohead released the soundboard recording of their\n2009 Prague performance for use in another fan-made concert video.
