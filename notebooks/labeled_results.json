Nash received the most votes for first-team\nAll-NBA and was joined by teammate Stoudemire; the two were the first\nteammates to make the first team since Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal in\n2003\u201304. Nash received 129 first-place votes and 645 total points from the\npanel of 129 media members. He narrowly missed being MVP a third\nconsecutive time, coming in second with 44 first place votes to 83 for Dirk\nNowitzki. In the 2007 playoffs, the Suns eliminated the Lakers in five\ngames before losing 4\u20132 to the Spurs in the conference semifinals.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.739190101623535\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n:\nIn the 2000\u201301 season, Nash averaged 15.6 points and 7.3 assists per game in a\nbreakout season. With Nash directing the team's offense, Nowitzki and\nFinley playing at their best, and the acquisition of All-Star Juwan Howard\ncomplementing the high-scoring trio, the Mavericks earned a playoff berth for\nthe first time in more than a decade. Dallas lost in the Western Conference\nSemifinals four games to one to the San Antonio Spurs, but it marked the\nbeginning of a memorable run for Nash and the Mavericks. In the 2001\u201302\nseason, Nash posted career-highs of 17.9 points and 7.7 assists per game\nand earned a spot in the NBA All-Star Game and on the All-NBA Third\nTeam. He was now an All-Star, increasingly appearing in television\ncommercials and, with Finley and Nowitzki, a part of the Dallas Mavericks \"Big\nThree\". Dallas earned another trip to the playoffs but lost again in the\nSemifinals to the Sacramento Kings four games to one.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.565723419189453\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n:\nNash closely replicated his previous season's performance in the 2002\u201303\nseason, averaging 17.7 points and 7.3 assists per game, again earning All-\nStar and All-NBA Third Team honours. Nowitzki and Nash led the\nMavericks from a 14-game winning streak to open the season all the way to the\nWestern Conference finals, where they lost to the eventual NBA champions, the\nSan Antonio Spurs four games to two. It was only the second Conference\nfinals appearance in the franchise's history. The 2003\u201304 season saw an\noffensively boosted Mavericks roster (with the acquisitions of Antoine Walker\nand Antawn Jamison) but a dip in Nash's scoring contributions. As a result, he\nwas not selected for the All-Star and All-NBA team rosters even though he\nachieved new career highs in assists per game (8.8) and free throw accuracy\n(91.6%). In the 2004 playoffs, the fifth-seeded Dallas failed to make\nprogress yet again as the Sacramento Kings saw them off four games to one.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.0388550758361816\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n:\nIt was in Dallas that Nash established himself as a formidable point guard,\nbeginning a decade as one of the game's top players. During his first year as\na Maverick (the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 season) he started in all 40 games\nhe played in, and averaged 7.9 points, 2.9 rebounds and 5.5 assists per\ngame. The 19\u201331 Mavericks failed to make the 1999 playoffs, but in the\n1999\u20132000 season, the team's prospects improved considerably. Nash missed 25\nmid-season games due to an ankle injury, but came back to record six double-\ndoubles in the last month of play. He finished the season with averages of\n8.6 points and 4.9 assists per game. More importantly for the team,\nsecond-year teammate and friend Dirk Nowitzki was blossoming quickly into a\ntop player, veteran Michael Finley was having an All-Star-calibre year, and\nthe team's new owner, billionaire Mark Cuban, was bringing new energy and\nexcitement to the franchise. Nash now had a supportive environment in which he\ncould thrive.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.669842004776001\nSteve Nash Stats, Height, Weight, Position, Draft Status and more ...\n:\nSteve Nash averaged 14.3 points, 3.0 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.2624080181121826\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n:\nNash played in 81 regular season games during the 2007\u201308 season; in this\ncampaign, the Western Conference was especially competitive and he led the\nSuns to 55 wins and the sixth seed for the 2008 playoffs. Although there was a\ndip in his regular season output, Nash's shooting remained sharp; the accuracy\nof his shooting was on par with his 2005\u201306 MVP campaign (shooting at least\n50% from the field, 40% from the three-point arc, and 90% from the free throw\nline). On 31 January 2008, he collected his All-Star stripes for the sixth\ntime in his career. However, Nash continued to experience agony in the\nplayoffs. Despite a mid-season trade that sent Shawn Marion to the Miami Heat\nand brought four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal to the team, the Suns were\ndefeated in the first round of the 2008 playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs for\nthe third time in four years. In the deciding Game 5, Nash was perceived\nto have suffered from \"elimination-game jitters\", and turned over the ball\ntwice in the final two minutes of what was a tight contest. Nevertheless,\nNash was later named to the All-NBA Second Team for the 2007\u201308 season.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.02942156791687\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n:\nNash was praised for his playmaking, ball-handling skills and shooting. He led\nthe league in assists for five years, averaging 11.5 assists per game in\n2004\u201305, 10.5 in 2005\u201306, 11.6 in 2006\u201307, 11.0 in 2009\u201310 and 11.4 in\n2010\u201311 and won the NBA Skills Challenge in 2005 and 2010. As of the\nend of 2012\u201313 season, he had a 90.4% career free throw shooting average\n(formerly the best in NBA history, as of 2013[update] second to Stephen\nCurry) and a 42.8% career three-point shooting average (eighth-best\nin league history), and ranked as one of the top 10 players in league\nhistory in total assists, assists per game, and three-point field goals\nmade. He is ranked second (starting from 1986\u201387) in regular\nseason point\u2013assist double doubles. In the 2005\u201306 season, Nash became\nthe fourth player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better from the field, 40%\nfrom three-point range (43.9), and 90% from the line, joining Larry Bird,\nReggie Miller, and Mark Price in the 50\u201340\u201390 club. Nash would repeat\nthis feat three more times in the 2007\u201308, 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310 campaigns.\nNash (four times), Larry Bird and Kevin Durant (two times each) are the only\nplayers to have accomplished this feat more than once.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.746814489364624\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n:\nIn his rookie season, Nash only managed 10.5 minutes a game, but in his\nsecond season, his playing time increased significantly and he was even ranked\n13th in the league for three-point field-goal percentage. Nevertheless, the\nCanadian's tenure with the Suns did not last. Nelson had just taken a job as\nassistant general manager of the Dallas Mavericks under his father, Don\nNelson, and convinced him to acquire the under-utilised Nash. Following\nthe 1998 NBA draft, Nash was traded from the Suns to the Mavericks in exchange\nfor Martin M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp, Bubba Wells, the draft rights to Pat Garrity and a first-\nround draft pick (who later turned out to be future Phoenix teammate Shawn\nMarion).\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.7181230783462524\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n:\nNash originally attended Mount Douglas Secondary School in Saanich, British\nColumbia, but after his grades began to drop, his parents decided to enroll\nhim at St. Michaels University School, a private school in Victoria.\nThere, he starred in basketball, soccer, and rugby union. While playing\nbasketball during his senior season, Nash averaged 21.3 points, 11.2 assists,\nand 9.1 rebounds per game. In the 1991\u201392 season, he led his team in his\nfinal year to the British Columbia AAA provincial championship title, and was\nnamed the province's Player of the Year.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.6072503328323364\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n:\nIn February 2012, Nash was named to his eighth All-Star Game. At the time, he\nwas leading the NBA in assists per game. On 21 April 2012, Nash passed\nOscar Robertson for career assists versus the Denver Nuggets. Despite his\nstellar play the Suns missed the 2012 playoffs for the second consecutive\ntime. He finished the season averaging 12.5 points and 10.7 assists per game\non 53.2% shooting from the field (tying his career high). Near the end of the\n2011\u201312 season, Nash was named the winner of the PBWA's Magic Johnson Award.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.7985987663269043\nSteve Nash | Biography, Coach, & Facts | Britannica\n:\nThe Suns advanced to the Western Conference finals in 2004\u201305. The team lost\naggressive forward Amar\u2019e Stoudemire to injury in the next preseason and yet,\ndespite the absence of one of the league\u2019s best young players, once again\nappeared in the conference finals in 2005\u201306. Nash himself was even better,\naveraging a personal-best 18.8 points per game. In 2006\u201307, with Stoudemire\nback, the Suns dominated the NBA for much of the season, finishing with the\nsecond best record in the league (61\u201321). However, giving Nash a third\nconsecutive MVP would have put him in the same class as all-time greats Bill\nRussell, Wilt Chamberlain, and Larry Bird. The voters balked. He finished\nsecond in the MVP voting to Nowitzki. The Suns then had a disappointing\npostseason, losing in the conference semifinals.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.7439217567443848\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n:\nDuring the 2013\u201314 season, Nash continued to suffer nerve problems stemming\nfrom his leg injury the prior season. In November 2013, he was sidelined for\nan estimated minimum of two weeks due to nerve root irritation. Nash\nreturned on 4 February 2014, shooting 3-for-6 for 7 points. On 7 February\n2014, his 40th birthday, he scored a season-high 19 points in a victory over\nthe Philadelphia 76ers. On 13 March, Nash was ruled out for the remainder\nof the season by D'Antoni. He was suffering from a recurrence of nerve\nproblems stemming from an earlier collision to his left leg with Chicago's\nKirk Hinrich, and the Lakers wanted to give Kendall Marshall and Jordan Farmar\nmore playing time. However, Nash returned on 21 March after a groin injury to\nFarmar that was expected to sideline him a minimum of two weeks.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.5302670001983643\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n:\n      * 5\u00d7 NBA assists leader (2005\u20132007, 2010, 2011)\n      * 4\u00d7 50\u201340\u201390 club (2006, 2008\u20132010)\n      * No. 13 retired by Phoenix Suns\n      * NBA 75th Anniversary Team\n      * 2\u00d7 FIBA AmeriCup MVP (1999, 2003)\n      * Lou Marsh Trophy (2005)\n      * 3\u00d7 Lionel Conacher Award (2002, 2005, 2006)\n      * 2\u00d7 WCC Player of the Year (1995, 1996)\n      * 2\u00d7 First-team All-WCC (1995, 1996)\n      * No. 11 retired by Santa Clara Broncos  \nCareer statistics  \nPoints  17,387 (14.3 ppg)  \nRebounds  3,642 (3.0 rpg)  \nAssists  10,335 (8.5 apg)  \nStats at NBA.com  \nStats at Basketball-Reference.com  \nBasketball Hall of Fame as player  \nFIBA Hall of Fame as player  \nMedals     \n   \nRepresenting  Canada  \nFIBA AmeriCup  \n   1999 San Juan   National team  \n   2001 Neuqu\u00e9n   National team  \nUniversiade  \n   1991 Sheffield   National team  \n   1993 Buffalo   National team  \n  \n**Stephen John Nash** OC OBC (born 7 February 1974) is a Canadian professional\nbasketball coach and former player who most recently served as head coach of\nthe Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Although\nhe still managed to play in 50 games, his effectiveness was limited, and his\nplay was merely league-average. Despite the preseason hype, the injury-plagued\nand dysfunctional Lakers were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs\nthat season. Complications from the broken leg limited Nash to just 15 games\nthe following year as Los Angeles struggled through another disappointing\ncampaign. In October 2014 the Lakers announced that Nash would miss the entire\n2014\u201315 season because of recurring nerve damage in his back. He retired from\nprofessional basketball in March 2015 and soon thereafter became a part-time\nconsultant for the Golden State Warriors.

On 21 January 2010,\nNash was named as the starting point guard for the West for the 2010 NBA All-\nStar Game. With him operating at the point, the Suns were the highest-\nscoring team in the league for the fifth season in a row, and were seeded\nthird in the conference for the 2010 playoffs with 54 wins. Behind solid\nperformances by Richardson and veteran Grant Hill, the Suns defeated the\nPortland Trail Blazers 4\u20132 in the first round of the playoffs, and swept the\nSpurs 4\u20130 in the second round. The Suns met the defending champions, Los\nAngeles Lakers, in the conference finals. After losing the first two games,\nPhoenix won the next two to tie the series. A Ron Artest buzzer-beater in Game\n5 pushed the Lakers one game closer to the Finals, and Kobe Bryant's 37 points\nin Game 6 completed the defeat of the Suns.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> -0.46752527356147766\nSteve Nash - Wikipedia\n:\nIn the next season, Stoudemire suffered a serious knee injury, and Johnson and\nQuentin Richardson were traded away. The Suns were not expected to repeat\ntheir successful 2005 season, but with Nash directing the same high-tempo\noffence, the team compiled a respectable 54\u201328 record and won the division\ntitle. On 2 January 2006, Nash recorded 28 points, 5 rebounds and 22\nassists in a 140\u2013133 triple overtime loss to the New York Knicks. The Suns\nwere again the highest-scoring team in the league with seven players averaging\ndouble figures in points per game, and Nash was voted for the first time\nto start for the 2006 Western All-Star team. In the last game of the\nseason, Nash recorded a triple-double of 16 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists\nin a 106\u201396 road win over the Trail Blazers. Having recorded career highs\nin points (18.8), rebounds (4.2), field goal percentage (.512) and free throw\npercentage (a league-leading .921), and leading the league with 10.5 assists\nper game, Nash was named the league MVP for the second year in a row.\nIn the first round of the 2006 playoffs, Phoenix overcame a 3\u20131 deficit\nagainst the Los Angeles Lakers and won the series 4\u20133. The Los Angeles\nClippers were their Conference semifinals opponents, and the Suns again needed\nseven games to clinch the series.

In 1842 the Great Fire of\nHamburg destroyed a third of the city and left around 20,000 people homeless.\nFrom the rubble a new modern city centre was built, followed by the grand\nSpeicherstadt warehouse district.

The\nHamburg-American line HAPAG, which was to assume a dominant position in\ntransatlantic shipping, was founded in 1847. The city was badly hit by a fire\nin 1842, which destroyed 1,749 houses, 102 warehouses, and rendered over one-\ntenth of the population homeless.

The experience of\nnational elections proved traumatic, as Hamburg's social democrats quickly\nconquered the city's three parliamentary districts (the third was taken in\n1890). The fact that Hamburg was thus represented, at the national level, by\nelements regarded as foreign to the burgher population, reinforced\nantisocialist sentiment at home.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.4836699962615967\nA Brief History Of Hamburg\n:\nAlso, the two world wars have left their traces in Hamburg\u2019s history.

However, revealing that the lodger actually is the killer has the\neffect of undermining some of the point of staging the story among bystanders-\nif you really have Jack the Ripper living upstairs, then how ordinary are you?  \n  \nOver the years, different adaptations have approached this hiccup in their own\nways. The original 1913 novel by Marie Belloc Lowndes samples bits of the\nlegendary case of Jack the Ripper into a (then) modern-day London terrorized\nby \"the Avenger.\" The first film version, Alfred Hitchcock's _The Lodger_\n(1927), keeps the contemporary setting, the \"Avenger\" name, and works as a\ncase study in paranoia. Hitchcock's lodger is no killer, and the audience's\nbelief otherwise is used to demonstrate how easily we are led astray by fear.  \n  \nWhen Fox producer Robert Bassler set out to make a B-level thriller from the\nbook in 1944, it was decided to bring the highly exploitable Jack the Ripper\nconnection front and center and set the story in 1880s Whitechapel.\nScreenwriter Barr\u00e9 Lyndon found certain story details forbidden by skittery\ncensors. Although 1944 audiences were tough stuff-this was the Greatest\nGeneration, facing down international fascism and gearing up to drop nuclear\nbombs on Japan-the Motion Picture Code believed such people would be\nscandalized by the sight of blood or the explicit mention of sex, so a story\nabout a serial killer who disembowels prostitutes had to use some sly\nnarrative dodges to get its point across. But where the censors could omit\nfrom the printed screenplay the most direct mentions of taboo subjects, they\nhad no such reign on the fevered imaginations of the filmmakers, who managed\nto sneak depravity into every corner of the film through suggestion and bold\nartistry.  \n  \nDirector John Brahm was a German immigrant with a background in Expressionist\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.8799630403518677\nThe Lodger (1944) - Turner Classic Movies\n:\nSanders as the detective.

After three weeks of availability, it sold over 17 million copies, and would soon surpass the all-time champ, Disney's _Aladdin_ (with 24 million copies sold since its late-1993 release). It eventually sold 50 million copies worldwide, the best-selling cassette of all time.

It used revolutionary digital photo tricks (digital compositing) to insert the film's main character into archival historical footage with three past Presidents (John F. Kennedy, LBJ and Nixon), and celebrities like Elvis Presley and John Lennon. It would encourage the trend of physically inserting actors into old existing footage, making it appear like the characters were interacting with each other. Shortly afterwards, this technique - which expanded to advertising commercials \\- controversially presented dead stars hawking products (i.e., James Cagney and Louis Armstrong appeared in Diet Coke ads, and John Wayne was in a Coors Light commercial). _Forrest Gump's_ most impressive and surprising effect was the digitally amputated legs of actor Gary Sinise, playing a war vet.  \n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.7323923110961914\nThe 100+ Best Movies From 1994, Ranked By Fans\n:\nrerankers (47)\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.444810390472412\nThe 100+ Best Movies From 1994, Ranked By Fans\n:\nThese are the best movies of 1994, from instant classics like Pulp Fiction to\nhilarious PG-13 Comedies like Dumb and Dumber.

However, because of the higher wage level and hence production costs,\nEurope is suffering from deindustrialization and offshoring in the labour-\nintensive manufacturing sectors.

If two\nteams tied for the conference lead, they would meet in a one-game playoff to\ndetermine the conference champion. In 1967, the NFL expanded from 15 teams to\n16 teams. Instead of just evening out the conferences by adding the expansion\nNew Orleans Saints to the seven-member Western Conference, the NFL realigned\nthe conferences and split each into two four-team divisions. The four division\nchampions would meet in the NFL playoffs, a two-round playoff. The NFL\nalso operated the Playoff Bowl (officially the Bert Bell Benefit Bowl) from\n1960 to 1969. Effectively, a third-place game, pitting the two conference\nrunners-up against each other, the league considers Playoff Bowls to have been\nexhibitions rather than playoff games.

That\nmeans it was impossible to write and record and release it in late 1971. then\nI think that they happened to get the same idea of the writing of the lyrics\nof the song. But what still puzzled me was that there were some key words on\nthe lyrics of the songs on that album released by Led Zeppelin in 1971. For\nexample, the word 'Book of love' on the song 'Rock n Roll', or the last song\nof the album 'When levee Breaks'. Because there were same words on the song\n'American Pie', too.

One of those iconic pieces is Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven,\" which is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its premier live performance tomorrow, March 5. Although the studio album that contains the track (technically untitled, but commonly referred to as _Led Zeppelin IV_) was not released until November 1971, the song was performed at nearly every subsequent Led Zeppelin show after March 5, 1971, turning it into a fan favorite. It was one of the most requested and played songs on American rock radio stations in the 1970s. The song came back into the spotlight in 2014 when Led Zeppelin were sued for copyright infringement by the band Spirit, who claimed that \"Stairway to Heaven\" was copied from their instrumental track \"Taurus.\" In late 2020, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, meaning that Led Zeppelin had won the court battle.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.95580530166626\nStairway To Heaven by Led Zeppelin - Songfacts\n:\n* Led Zeppelin started planning \"Stairway\" in early 1970 when they decided to create a new, epic song to replace \"Dazed And Confused\" as the centerpiece of their concerts. Jimmy Page would work on the song in an 8-track studio he had installed in his boathouse, trying out different sections on guitar. By April, he was telling journalists that their new song might be 15-minutes long, and described it as something that would \"build towards a climax\" with John Bonham's drums not coming in for some time. In October 1970, after about 18 months of near constant touring, the song took shape. Page and Plant explained that they started working on it at a 250-year-old Welsh cottage called Bron-yr-Aur, where they wrote the songs for **Led Zeppelin III**. Page sometimes told a story of the pair sitting by a fire at the cabin as they composed it, a tale that gives the song a mystical origin story, as there could have been spirits at play within those walls.  \n  \nPage told a different story under oath: When he was called to the stand in\n2016 as part of a plagiarism trial over this song, he said that he wrote the\nmusic on his own and first played it for his bandmates at Headley Grange in\nLiphook Road, Headley, Hampshire, where they recorded it using a mobile studio\nowned by The Rolling Stones. Plant corroborated the story in his testimony.  \n  \nHeadley Grange may not be as enchanting as Bron-yr-Aur, but the place had some\ncharacter: It was a huge, old, dusty mansion with no electricity but great\nacoustics. Bands would go there to get some privacy and focus on songwriting,\nas the biggest distractions were the sheep and other wildlife.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.90733528137207\nStairway To Heaven by Led Zeppelin - Songfacts\n:\n  \nIt would be their biggest hit. The band declined an invitation to Woodstock\nand fractured in 1972, with California's already volatile mental health\nravaged by drug use. The band reunited from time to time, but never got their\ndue. By the time of California's death, few remembered \"Taurus\" and its\nconnection to \"Stairway To Heaven,\" but in 1999, Songfacts went online and the\ndiscussion was revived.  \n  \nIn 2002, a former music journalist named Michael Skidmore came into control of\nCalifornia's estate, and 2014 he began proceedings against Led Zeppelin. In\n2016, Jimmy Page testified in the case and said that the first time he heard\nof the controversy when a few years earlier when his son-in-law told him that\na debate had been brewing online. Page insisted he had never heard \"Taurus\"\nbefore, and that it was \"totally alien\" to him.  \n  \nThe jury didn't buy the argument that Page never heard \"Taurus,\" but still\nruled in favor of Led Zeppelin, deciding that the chord progression in\n\"Taurus\" was common to many other songs dating back decades, and therefore, in\nthe public domain. In 2018, the case was sent back to trial on appeal, but the\nruling was upheld two years later. Here's a timeline of the case.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.905292510986328\nStairway to Heaven | Rock Music Wiki | Fandom\n:\n\"Stairway to Heaven\" is often rated among the greatest rock songs of all\ntime. According to music journalist Stephen Davis, although the song\nwas released in 1971, it took until 1973 before the song's popularity ascended\nto truly \"anthemic\" status. As Page himself recalled, \"I knew it was good,\nbut I didn't know it was going to be almost like an anthem ... But I knew it\nwas the gem of the album, sure.\"\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.8716936111450195\nStairway To Heaven by Led Zeppelin - Songfacts\n:\n* Bertrand from Paris, FranceJimmy had already recorded some demos of the acoustic introduction in October 1970, during their second stay at Bron-yr-Aur. Part of the track already existed before the band went to Headley Grange to prepare and record the album, but the final composition (notably Plant's lyrics) and the arrangements were completed in Headley.  \n  \nAlthough Jimmy's famous guitar solo for the studio version of the song was\ndone on his Fender Telecaster, in order to be able to play this masterpiece in\nconcert, he bought what was to become one of the icons of the band, namely the\nfamous Gibson (EDS-1275 Doubleneck), featuring 12 strings on the upper neck\nand 6 on the other (the 6-string neck was used for the arpeggio in the\nintroduction and the solo, the 12-string neck for the rest of the song), which\nwas a heavy equipment to carry in concert. Contrary to what is often read,\nJimmy Page didn't have this model made to measure for himself: it has been in\nGibson's catalogue since 1958, but it had remained distributed on a\nconfidential basis until Jimmy made it famous. John McLaughlin, for instance,\nhad used it before him.  \n  \nThere are no satanist hidden messages neither in \"Stairway To Heaven,\" nor in\n\"Hotel California\" by the Eagles or other songs 'accused' of containing hidden\nmessages when played backwards (even if some deliberated cases do exist, such\nas \"Empty Spaces\" by Pink Floyd and \"Fire On a High\" by Electric Light\nOrchestra). These rumors were launched in California by a committee of puritan\nparents and religious leaders who wanted to show that rock 'n' roll was\nleading children to satanism. They listened to dozen and dozen of tracks\nbackwards (!) , hoping to find evidence in line with the above.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.556959629058838\nStairway to Heaven | Rock Music Wiki | Fandom\n:\nThe group's recording of this song also appeared as the sole Led Zeppelin\ntrack in the 1977 Atlantic Records 2-LP promotional sampler album,  _We've Got\nYour Music_ , marking the first time that Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway To Heaven\"\nmade its official debut appearance in an American-released various artists\ncompilation collection.\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",

Based on his own original screenplay and\nco-produced with Thomas, the film is set amid World War II in 1940 and the\nevacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France. Describing\nthe film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, Nolan wanted to make a\n\"sensory, almost experimental movie\" with minimal dialogue. He said he\nwaited to make _Dunkirk_ until he had earned the trust of a major studio to\nlet him make it as a British film but with an American budget. Before\nfilming, Nolan sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview\nwith _Variety_ , \"knowing and respecting that Chris [Nolan] is one of the\nworld's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his\nimagination, as I did on _Ryan_ , in second position to the research he was\ndoing to authentically acquit this historical drama\".

Though he made his feature debut\nwith the ultra-low budget indie, \"Following\" (1998), Nolan put himself on the\nmap with \"Memento\" (2000), a classic revenge story with the unique twist of\nbeing told backwards. Hailed by many critics and - by indie standards - made\nsuccessful by a rabid audience, \"Memento\" quickly turned Nolan's fortunes,\nestablishing him as a highly sought-after talent. He soon followed with the\nthriller \"Insomnia\" (2002), starring heavy-hitters Al Pacino, Hilary Swank and\nRobin Williams. But it was the blockbuster \"Batman Begins\" (2005) - a\nreimagined take on a long-defunct film franchise - that propelled Nolan to the\nupper tier of Hollywood directors. His dark, brooding take on the avenging\ncrusader was much more aligned with its original intention than any other\nsubsequent incarnation had been, earning critical praise, audience admiration\nand a large chunk of box office dollars. With \"The Prestige\" (2006), \"The Dark\nKnight\" (2008) and \"Inception\" (2010), his reputation as an auteur working in\na blockbuster world was firmly cemented.

Investors in the company with a PE ratio of 30 are\npaying $30 for $1 of earnings.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.786606550216675\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: What PE Ratio Is And How to Use It - ...\n:\nPE ratios are simple \u2014 they're just the price of a stock or index, divided by\nits past or future earnings \u2014 yet they're some of the most powerful tools for\nidentifying undervalued or overvalued stocks, and forecasting future returns.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.6645026206970215\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: What PE Ratio Is And How to Use It - ...\n:\nThe Shiller PE ratio is intended to provide a \"smoother\" measure of stock\nmarket valuations than an index's regular PE ratio, which may whipsaw up and\ndown during periods of volatility.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.5614166259765625\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: What PE Ratio Is And How to Use It - ...\n:\nIn this instance, the stock price may stay the same while the company\u2019s\nearnings increase, which would send the PE ratio lower. Investors may see this\nas an opportunity to buy the stock with the expectation that the price will\nrise in the future to reflect the underlying earnings increase, a strategy\nthat aligns with value investing.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.489821195602417\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: What PE Ratio Is And How to Use It - ...\n:\n\u201cPE ratio\u201d may sound technical, but it\u2019s really just a comparison of how the\npublic feels about a company (its stock price) and how well the company is\nactually doing (its EPS). The reading (and its inferences) can also be applied\nto market indexes, such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and\nNasdaq.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.4770214557647705\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: What PE Ratio Is And How to Use It - ...\n:\n\u201cTypically, stocks selling at higher PE ratios have higher growth expectations\nthan those selling at lower PE ratios,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cIn essence, investors\nare willing to pay a higher premium for current earnings because they expect\nfuture earnings to grow substantially.\u201d\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.4261107444763184\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: What PE Ratio Is And How to Use It - ...\n:\nTo arrive at a company\u2019s PE ratio, you\u2019ll need to first know its EPS, which is\ncalculated by dividing the company\u2019s net profits by the number of shares of\ncommon stock it has outstanding.

The price-to-\nearnings ratio, or P/E ratio, helps you compare the price of a company\u2019s stock\nto the earnings the company generates. This comparison helps you understand\nwhether markets are overvaluing or undervaluing a stock. The P/E ratio is a\nkey tool to help you compare the valuations of individual stocks or entire\nstock indexes, such as the S&P 500. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the P/E\nratio in depth, learn how to calculate a P/E ratio, and understand how it can\nhelp you make sound investment decisions.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.2754178047180176\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: What PE Ratio Is And How to Use It - ...\n:\nHere\u2019s one scenario: A company posts stable profits quarter after quarter, and\nits projected profits are equally stable. If its stock price jumps but its\nearnings stay the same (and no earnings increases are expected), the company\u2019s\nintrinsic value didn\u2019t change; the market\u2019s perception of the company did.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.2202930450439453\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: What PE Ratio Is And How to Use It - ...\n:\nTo understand this from a technical view, remember the formula. If earnings\nfall but the stock price remains the same, the PE ratio will rise, suggesting\nthe company may not be as valuable as the stock price reflects.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.219536781311035\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: What PE Ratio Is And How to Use It - ...\n:\n\u201cUsing the PE ratio to take advantage of perceived under- or over-valuations\nin the market would require that the ratio always reverts to some historical\naverage. The reality is that the PE ratio is not a great basis for investment\ndecisions because there is simply no magic number to which the ratio tends to\nrevert.\u201d\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",

And what he's proposing for a second term goes\nfar beyond what he tried to accomplish the first - with ideas that are far\nmore extreme. He is proposing what he calls the largest-ever deportation\noperation in American history. He says that he wants to reimpose that travel\nban that targeted Muslim-majority countries. He wants to expand that. He's\nproposing these ideological tests where he says that anybody coming into the\ncountry - they will test to see whether they're communists, whether they are\nbigots and people who dislike the United States - that he will bar those\npeople as well. And he's also proposed a radical reinterpretation of the 14th\nAmendment that would bar the constitutional right of birthright citizenship to\npeople who are born in the country.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.160158157348633\nWhat are Trump's policy goals for a second term? : NPR\n:\nCOLVIN: Yeah, absolutely, and that's something, you know, that he was very\naggressive on in his first term in office. And, you know, he's somebody who\nhas been very skeptical of trade deals - you know, somebody who pulled out of\nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership. And so it's an area, you know, where he learned\nduring his first term that the president has a lot of, you know, ability to\npush through things without, you know, needing the help of Congress.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.556719779968262\nWhat are Trump's policy goals for a second term? : NPR\n:\nCOLVIN: Well, there's been a long-standing tradition in this country of the\nJustice Department being thought of as independent from the White House, from\nthe president. You know, it's quite, you know, stunning to hear, you know, a\npolitical candidate talking about using that power to target their political\nenemies. But, you know, we saw during Trump's first term the extent to which\nhe really thought of the federal government as sort of his - he implied that\nthe lawyers who worked in the White House counsel's office and the Justice\nDepartment as sort of being his lawyers, and they're to serve him. And so this\nis really an extension of that kind of thinking.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.955658197402954\nWhat are Trump's policy goals for a second term? : NPR\n:\nThe public's heard a lot about Donald Trump's legal challenges, but what will\nhappen if he survives those and wins the election a year from now? His\nproposals haven't gotten that much attention. He's sat out the Republican\ndebates. But to his base, he's been busy outlining his goals, and in many\ncases, he's promising to go further than he did in his first term. Jill Colvin\nis a national political reporter for the Associated Press. She's been\nfollowing Trump's 2024 campaign and joins us now. Welcome to the program.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.7825100421905518\nWhat are Trump's policy goals for a second term? : NPR\n:\nCOLVIN: Trump and his allies are extraordinarily more prepared if he wins a\nsecond term in office. You know, when they arrived at the White House in 2017,\nit was chaos. They knew very little about the levers of federal power. They\ntried to push through these executive orders that were immediately mired in\nthe courts, had to go through one iteration after the next in order to get\nthese things to stand up legally. And so they are far more prepared not just\nbecause they had four years in office to sort of learn, you know, the levers\nof federal power but because they've had these years since to work on these\nissues, to lay out plans.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.7435097694396973\nWhat are Trump's policy goals for a second term? : NPR\n:\nDONALD TRUMP: We will start by exposing every last crime committed by crooked\nJoe Biden because now that he indicted me, we're allowed to look at him. And I\nwill direct a completely overhauled DOJ to investigate every Marxist\nprosecutor in America.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.6853437423706055\nWhat are Trump's policy goals for a second term? : NPR\n:\nCOLVIN: You know, it's interesting. At Trump's rallies now, he gets the\nbiggest applause line still when he talks about transgender issues and\nproposes things like banning men from participating in women's sports, you\nknow? He says that he will push Congress to enact a bill establishing that\nthere are only two genders recognized by the U.S. government. And it's not\njust transgender issues that he's been talking about. He's also been talking\nabout crime, you know, sending the federal - you know, National Guard into\ncities like Chicago that he deems out of control, talking about a federal\ntakeover of Washington, D.C., because of crime and because when he drives\nthrough, he sees graffiti that he doesn't like. These proposals really, you\nknow, run the gamut and are quite popular with his supporters.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.558755874633789\nWhat are Trump's policy goals for a second term? : NPR\n:\nRASCOE: As we mentioned earlier, Trump is caught in a web of criminal\nindictments and civil suits. It seems like he has a plan for dealing with even\nthat. Here's a clip of what Trump said earlier this month.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.53361439704895\nWhat are Trump's policy goals for a second term? : NPR\n:\nCOLVIN: Well, Trump, as I'm sure you'll not be surprised to hear, has been\nquite focused on tariffs. He wants to implement a universal tariff on all\nimported goods. He's talked about 10% as a potential benchmark. And the way\nthat Trump talks about tariffs - he presents it as though - that it doesn't\nimpact the price that the consumers pay when they're actually purchasing these\nitems, which, of course, is not the way that tariffs work.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.3524422645568848\nWhat are Trump's policy goals for a second term? : NPR\n:\nRASCOE: In addition to all of these, like, legal issues, there are a lot of\nissues that, you know, you could call culture wars that he has keyed in on a\nlot, like transgender rights. What has Trump said about these?\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.2481820583343506\nWhat are Trump's policy goals for a second term? : NPR\n:\nCOLVIN: Absolutely. I mean, this is, I think, the most significant thing that\nwe're going to be talking about today - the proposals that he has put forward\nreplacing, you know, everybody there - his perceived enemies. And he's gone as\nfar as to say that he intends to appoint a special prosecutor to go after\nBiden, to go after his family. He could even - and he intends, even - to go\nafter potential opponents if somebody is doing well, he says - if somebody is\npotentially beating him, even though he couldn't run for another term. He\nwants to go after those people and indict them as well. And so he's really\nviewing the Justice Department as a tool that he can use to enact retribution\nand to punish the people that he feels have gone after him unfairly.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.177272319793701\nWhat are Trump's policy goals for a second term? : NPR\n:\nRASCOE: Let's start with immigration - what many would consider to be a big\nweak spot for President Biden. This year alone, the U.S.-Mexico border has\nreceived a record number of migrants - 2.4 million - and that's causing\nproblems even in Democratic strongholds like Chicago and New York.

The 2010 Album was not the\nsame as the 1972 original, as it had a 10 Track 'Bonus Disk' with it. However,\nyou still credit The Beatles with 15 UK No.1 Albums, even though the 2017\nEdition of 'Sgt Pepper...' was not the same No.1 Album, as the original\n1967/1968 No.1. The 2017 No.1 should be counted as a different No.1 than the\n1960's original, because its Track List was not exactly the same. So, the 2017\n'Sgt Pepper...' should be regarded as The Beatles 16th UK No.1 Album. Just as\nthe 2019 'Abbey Road' Album should be credited as their 17th UK No.1 Album, if\nthat reaches No.1.

Of\ncourse, the fun song that gifted viewers the phrase \"_Who ya gonna call?_ \"\n(as well as a star-studded music video) became just as big of a hit as the\n_Ghostbusters_ film itself, but that was far from a sure thing in the months\nleading up to the film's release. From the other songs considered to the\namount of time Ray Parker Jr. was given to complete his task, the story behind\nthe _Ghostbusters_ theme is as captivating as the song itself.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 8.488080978393555\nGhostbusters: The Strange True Story Behind The Iconic Theme Song\n:\nParker Jr. was ultimately able to write and record his  _Ghostbusters_ theme\nin two and a half days. Upon completion, he hurriedly sent a cassette tape to\nIvan Reitman, who immediately incorporated it into the film. Though Parker Jr.\nwas originally asked to write less than a minute of music for the film's\nopening library scene, the track was extended to a radio-friendly four\nminutes. Ray Parker Jr.'s efforts were rewarded with a level of success he had\nnever seen. The _Ghostbusters_ theme quickly became a chart-topping smash and\nwas even nominated for Best Original Song at the 57th Academy Awards. Though\nit's likely that a theme-less ** _Ghostbusters_** still would have led to\nsequels and maybe even the return of Gozer in  _Ghostbusters: Afterlife_, Ray\nParker Jr.'s musical contribution surely helped the film become the undeniable\nclassic it is today.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.764214515686035\nGhostbusters (song) - Wikipedia\n:\nLindsey Buckingham, on his interview disc _Words & Music [A Retrospective]_,\nstated that he was approached to write the _Ghostbusters_ theme based on his\nsuccessful contribution to _National Lampoon's Vacation_ , \"Holiday Road\". He\ndeclined the opportunity as he did not want to be known as a soundtrack\nartist.[_citation needed_] Glenn Hughes and Pat Thrall also submitted a demo\nthat was ultimately rejected. The Hughes and Thrall version was later\nrewritten and used as the track \"Dance or Die\" for the 1987 film _Dragnet_.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.342249870300293\nGhostbusters: The Strange True Story Behind The Iconic Theme Song\n:\nBy Owen Danoff\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.315465927124023\nGhostbusters (song) - Wikipedia\n:\n1984 single by Ray Parker Jr.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.133008003234863\nGhostbusters: The Strange True Story Behind The Iconic Theme Song\n:\nJust as many aspects of  _Ghostbusters_ came down to quick decisions and snap\njudgments, Ray Parker Jr.'s involvement in the film was far from a sure thing.\nAs Aykroyd and co. were scrambling to finish the film and name the ghost in\nthe _Ghostbusters_ logo, Columbia Pictures was rumored to have reached out to\nLindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac fame, thanks to the success he had found\nwriting \"Holiday Road\" for  _National Lampoon's Vacation_ the previous year.\nThe film studio also received over sixty song submissions from other artists,\nnone of which were deemed usable (via _CBC_). Parker Jr. was only tapped to\nwrite the song after he had already booked a flight to Los Angeles for a\ncompletely different project - not to mention that he was, at the time,\nlargely focusing his efforts away from music in order to take care of his\nailing parents. He ended up extending his Los Angeles stay by a few days,\nwhich, incidentally, was all the time he would get.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.1251091957092285\nGhostbusters: The Strange True Story Behind The Iconic Theme Song\n:\nGiven that the  _Ghostbusters_ theme would come to be used for several future\n__ projects (presumably including the never-made original  _Ghostbusters 3),\n_it's remarkable that Ray Parker Jr. only had a few days to create it. When\nParker Jr. got involved, the movie was already in the mixing process, meaning\nthat music would be the next addition to the project. Though Parker Jr., a\nlongtime session guitarist, wrote the music quickly, he has admitted to\nstruggling with the theme song's lyrics. In the \"Ghostbusters\" episode of\nNetflix's  _The Movies That Made Us,_ Parker Jr. stated that he couldn't find\na good way to sing the word \"Ghostbusters,\" the inclusion of which was a must\nfor the studio. Thankfully, when Parker Jr. was shown a cut of the film, he\nwas struck by the in-movie Ghostbusters advertisement (which returns in\n_Ghostbusters: Afterlife_ 's _Force Awakens-_ esque trailer). This reminded\nParker Jr. of commercials for home services like plumbing and extermination,\nwhich led him to the phrase \"_Who ya gonna call?_ \"\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 7.014132022857666\nGhostbusters (song) - Wikipedia\n:\nRay Parker, Jr.'s \"Ghostbusters\" reached number one on the _Billboard_ Hot 100\nchart on August 11, 1984, two months after the film's release, and remained\nthere for three weeks. It spent a total of 21 weeks on the charts.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.950083255767822\nGhostbusters (song) - Wikipedia\n:\nParker was approached by the film's producers to create a theme song, although\nhe only had a few days to do so and the film's title seemed impossible to\ninclude in any lyrics. However, when watching television late at night, Parker\nsaw a cheap commercial for a local service that reminded him that the film had\na similar commercial featured for the fictional business. This inspired him\nto write the song as a pseudo-advertising jingle that the business could have\ncommissioned as a promotion.[_citation needed_]\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.898000240325928\nGhostbusters: The Strange True Story Behind The Iconic Theme Song\n:\n* Movies\n                        * SR Originals\n                        * Ghostbusters (1984) (1984)\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.88960599899292\nGhostbusters: The Strange True Story Behind The Iconic Theme Song\n:\nGiven the success and quality of the original  _Ghostbusters_ , it's a\nremarkable fact that the movie's production was both troubled and rushed.\nExtensive rewrites to the original  _Ghostbusters_ script, budget concerns\nfrom the studio, and a concise production window are just a few of the hurdles\n__ that creators Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ivan Reitman faced while\nmaking their film.__ As music is generally one of the last elements to be\nadded to a movie, the hectic and hurried nature of  _Ghostbusters'_\ndevelopment made finding the perfect theme song even more of a challenge.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.879340171813965\nGhostbusters (song) - Wikipedia\n:\n\"Ghostbusters\"  \n   \nOne of European variants of non-US artwork  \nSingle by Ray Parker Jr.  \nfrom the album _Ghostbusters: Original Soundtrack Album _  \nB-side  \"Ghostbusters\" (instrumental)  \nReleased  June 8, 1984  \nGenre\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.779766082763672\nGhostbusters Soundtrack | Ghostbusters Wiki | Fandom\n:\n* 6\\.

With proof of work, miners around\nthe world try to solve a complicated mathematical puzzle to be the first one\nto add a block to the blockchain. Ethereum, however, is working on moving to a\ndifferent form of transaction validation known as proof of stake. With proof\nof stake, a person can mine or validate transactions in a block based on how\nmany coins he owns.

This one features a man and woman who fall in love with one another\nbut they refuse to have sex because each one is married. Even though both are\nin horrendous relationships they still won't cross that line and we see their\nprogression through the years. While this animated short isn't nearly as funny\nor entertaining as some of Mulloy's best films, it still contains a certain\ncreative style that makes it worth seeing as long as you have a dark sense of\nhumor. I thought this was a pretty smart little movie that worked well because\nof the twist and turns in the love story. This isn't your typical love story\nbut I really liked the way the two characters struggled with what they should\ndo with their relationship. Some of your typical, dirty Mulloy humor comes\ninto play and especially during a dream sequence where a man has his you know\nwhat burned off. The animation is the same type that you expect from Mulloy\nand I think it fits the material just fine.

Many 007 fans and critics noted strong similarities with Heath Ledger's The Joker from Christopher Nolan's _The Dark Knight_ (2008). _Esquire Magazine_ ranked Silva #9 in the list of James Bond Villains, saying, \"Played with unhinged, eccentric anger, Silva is a Bond villain for the 21st century. He's a tragic monster, a sympathetic villain driven by personal hatred and rage, not world domination.\"\n                        * Silva is something of a rarity for the James Bond series in that, unlike the majority of the other main Bond villains, including all the other primary ones in the reboot series starring Daniel Craig so far, he is genuinely a tragic figure to some extent who was driven to revenge due to being sold out by M despite his genuine loyalty and drive to be a good, proactive agent when he was with MI6, and as a result, was tortured to the point that he was driven to a failed attempt at suicide before coming to the conclusion that getting revenge on M was all he had left to live for. Therefore, unlike most other Bond villains, who probably would have turned out the way they did regardless of their circumstances, Silva is a rare case in the franchise of someone who's turn to villainy possibly, if not probably, could have been avoided had M handled the situation differently, making him one of Bond's single most 3-dimensional, fleshed out and humanized adversaries in the whole series, rather than just another foe who's evil simply because they're a psychopath and they can be.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.880627632141113\nRaoul Silva | James Bond Wiki | Fandom\n:\n**Raoul Silva** , born **Tiago Rodriguez** , was a powerful cyber-terrorist\nand former Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6) operative who committed a\nseries of terrorist attacks as part of a larger plan to publicly discredit and\nkill M.

The name appears to originate with Neal Purvis and Robert Wade's first draft screenplay (dated November 2010), wherein he was \"a villain called Raoul Sousa (changed to Silva)\".\n                        * Discussing his character prior to _Skyfall'_ s release, actor Javier Bardem described Raoul Silva as \"more than a villain\". His co-star, Daniel Craig stated that Bond has a \"very important relationship\" to Silva.\n                        * In casting the role, director Sam Mendes admitted that he lobbied hard for Bardem to accept the part as he recognized the potential for the character to become one of the most memorable characters in the franchise, so wanted to create \"something [the audience] may consider to have been absent from the Bond movies for a long time\". He felt that Bardem was one of the few actors up to the task of becoming \"colourless\" and existing within the world of the film as something more than a function of the plot.\n                        * In preparing for the role, Bardem had the script translated into his native Spanish in order to better-understand his character, which Mendes cited as being a sign of the actor's commitment to the film.\n                        * Bardem dyed his hair blond for the role after brainstorming ideas with Mendes to come up with a distinct visual look for the character.\n                        * The character's YouTube identity \"Vials\" is an anagram for \"Silva\".\n                        * Javier Bardem confirmed that Silva has Portuguese ancestry during an interview.\n                        * His first name \"Tiago\" is a Portuguese equivalent of the name \"James\".\n                        * Javier Bardem is the first Spanish actor to portray a primary antagonist in a _007_ film.\n                        * Silva is similar to several other Bond villains: \n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.7083740234375\nSkyfall | James Bond 007\n:\n_Skyfall_ marks the first film for ten-time Oscar\u00ae-nominated cinematographer\nRoger Deakins to shoot on a digital camera.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.557931900024414\nSkyfall | James Bond 007\n:\nWhen it came time to casting Silva\u2019s mercenaries, Sam Mendes wanted actors\nrather than stuntmen.

By 2011, the films that featured\nJackson as a leading actor or supporting co-star had grossed a total of\n$2.81 to $4.91 billion at the North American box office. This placed\nhim as the seventh-highest-grossing lead actor and the second-highest-grossing\nactor, behind only voice actor Frank Welker. The 2009 edition of _The Guinness\nWorld Records_ , which uses a different calculation to determine film grosses,\nstated that Jackson is the world's highest-grossing actor, with $7.42 billion\ngenerated across 68 films. Subsequently, as of 2022, according to data\ncrunched by the Golden Globes, this total has ballooned out to more than $27\nbillion grossed across 152 movies, locking him in as the highest-grossing\nactor, and second-highest grossing person in film in general behind Stan Lee,\nwho was primarily known for his cameo work.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.083768844604492\nHave Morgan Freeman and Samuel L.

On its June 21, 2011, release,\nit tore into the US _Billboard_ Hot 100 at No.8 and reached No.1 that\nSeptember on the back of striking radio airplay. It was a similar story across\nthe globe: the song spent 10 phenomenal weeks at the top of the Australian\ncharts and a staggering seven weeks at No.2 in the UK, becoming the second-\nbest-seller of the year and massively outperforming many singles that had\nactually reached the top spot.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.88740348815918\n'Hands All Over': How Maroon 5\u2019s Third Album Reached For Glory\n:\nThe album\u2019s first single was \u201cMisery,\u201d a collaboration between Levine,\nguitarist Jesse Carmichael and long-time collaborator Sam Farrar, who was now\nincreasingly working with the band. Hitting radio in June 2010, in advance of\n_Hands All Over_ \u2019s release, the track received a critical thumbs-up and,\nalongside a video featuring another one of Maroon 5\u2019s provocative but tongue-\nin-cheek storylines, started its ascent up the charts. Its subsequent,\ninexplicable stalling outside the US Top 10 (at No.14) and a peak of No.30 in\nthe UK seemed at odds with the song\u2019s obvious commercial direction. A later\nnomination at the following year\u2019s Grammys for Best Pop Performance By A Duo\nOr Group With A Vocal would give the song the credit it deserved, but it set\nthe _Hands All Over_ campaign off on a shakier footing than had been expected.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.343700408935547\nHands All Over (album) - Wikipedia\n:\n* Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange\n                                            * Benny Blanco\n                                            * Shellback  \nMaroon 5 chronology  \n  _Call and Response:  \nThe Remix Album_  \n(2008)    _**Hands All Over**_  \n(2010)    _Overexposed_  \n(2012)  \n       \nSingles from _Hands All Over_  \n                                            1. \"Misery\"  \nReleased: June 22, 2010\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 5.158929824829102\nMaroon 5 - Wikipedia\n:\nIn November 2011, Maroon 5 performed \"Moves Like Jagger\" and \"Stereo Hearts\"\nwith Travie McCoy on _Saturday Night Live_ on November 5.

But bold actions sometimes\nconjure magic, and the decision to record the song with Levine\u2019s fellow judge\non the US reality show _The Voice_ was nothing short of inspired. The\nchemistry between Levine and Christina Aguilera had already played out\nobviously on screen and added a teasing narrative to a strong song. Aguilera\u2019s\nown musical career had proved erratic since her breakthrough with \u201cGenie In A\nBottle,\u201d in 1999, and her recent album, _Bionic_ , had underperformed, so the\ncollaboration marked a timely opportunity for both parties to give their chart\ncredentials a welcome boost.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.547188758850098\nHands All Over (album) - Wikipedia\n:\nOn July 12, 2011, the band re-released the album to include their summer hit\nand the fourth single \"Moves like Jagger\".\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.474397659301758\n'Hands All Over': How Maroon 5\u2019s Third Album Reached For Glory\n:\nMaroon 5 - Moves Like Jagger ft.

Enveloping the sexy, playful tone of the track, it was a homage to\nrock god Mick Jagger that managed to be reverential and yet super-cheeky at\nthe same time.

Its business spans from the\noil well to the gas pump, with a whole lot in between. The European company's\nsize and reach are important, because they mean that Shell can put money to\nwork where it sees the best opportunities. And when one portion of the company\nis struggling, there are other areas that will likely be doing better to help\noffset the pain. That's valuable, since Shell's core products, oil and natural\ngas, are commodities prone to volatile price swings.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 4.265598297119141\n2 Energy Giants With High-Yield Stocks | The Motley Fool\n:\nThe company, meanwhile, has the financial strength to achieve its aims.\nLeverage is higher than that of more conservative peers like **ExxonMobil**\nand **Chevron** , with long-term debt accounting for roughly 30% of the\ncompany's capital structure. However, that's not an unreasonable number, and\nShell is carrying around $18 billion in cash on its balance sheet as a safety\nvalve. Shell is not playing loose and fast with its balance sheet.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.8373093605041504\n2 Energy Giants With High-Yield Stocks | The Motley Fool\n:\nRight now, with oil prices low and global warming in the headlines, it's a\ntough time to love an energy company -- but don't be too hasty to dismiss\nShell. As the CEO has pointed out, the world still needs these energy sources,\nso someone needs to produce them. Shell is also more than just oil and gas. It\nhas been investing heavily in the ESG friendly electricity space, with plans\nto spend up to $3 billion a year on this business through 2025. That includes\nmore traditional electric facilities, as well as renewable power assets. While\nthat spending amounts to just 10% or so of the company's planned capital\ninvestments, the end goal is to thoughtfully create a new division that can\nstand toe-to-toe with Shell's energy operations.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.9141831398010254\n2 Energy Giants With High-Yield Stocks | The Motley Fool\n:\nWith a huge 6.6% yield, a large, solid financial foundation, and a diversified\nportfolio of energy assets that will increasingly include electricity, Shell\nis worth a deep dive for dividend investors in search of high yields.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.8353142738342285\n2 Energy Giants With High-Yield Stocks | The Motley Fool\n:\nShell and Enterprise are two of the biggest players in the spaces they serve.\nThey are both investing for the future, and working off of strong financial\nfoundations. And, at the same time, they are paying investors well, with\n6%-plus yields. Before you dismiss these high-yield giants because they are in\nthe out-of-favor energy sector, you should dig in a little bit deeper. Shell\nis working to \"clean up\" its business, and oil prices aren't all that\nimportant to Enterprise's top and bottom lines.

The 2014 movie portrays Annie as a foster child instead of an orphan,\nwhich on one hand could be seen as a positive representation of children in a\nnon-traditional living environment, but also seems to diminish the plot.

Short (just 77 minutes, with credits), shocking, and\nunforgettable, it\u2019s unsparing in its depiction of the horrific event but never\nfeels exploitative. Though the attack itself takes up much of the film, its\nfinal stretch reveals it\u2019s less concerned with attempting to make sense of\nwhat happened than what happens next to those who survive \u2014 some of whom\nstruggle to find meaning and a will to go on.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.0789129734039307\nAll 4 Denis Villeneuve Sci-Fi Movies, Ranked\n:\nIt's been clear for a while now, and seems to get clearer and clearer with\neach new release, but **Denis Villeneuve** is undoubtedly one of the most\nexciting and consistently interesting filmmakers working today.

There is still story left to tell within the _Dune_\nuniverse, of course, and Villeneuve has expressed interest in adapting Frank\nHerbert's second _Dune_ novel, _**Dune: Messiah**_, which could ultimately\nmake this a trilogy. But, for now, it's a _Duneology_, and these two movies\nwork in tandem to be a complete adaptation of the original 1965 novel, with it\nbeing likely that once both movies are accessible at home, many viewers will\nopt to treat _Dune_ and _Dune: Part Two_ as an entire epic worth marathoning.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.2965188026428223\nEvery Denis Villeneuve Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\n:\n* Movie Features\n                                                * Denis Villeneuve\n                                                * Dune (2021)\n                                                * Arrival (2016)\n                                                * Blade Runner 2049 (2017)\n                                                * Dune: Part Two (2024)\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.2771308422088623\nThe Best Denis Villeneuve Movies, Ranked\n:\nIn addition to reconsidering his approach to film, Villeneuve spent the years\nafter his first films working on screenplays for _Polytechnique_ and\n_Incendies_ , which he made one after the other.

An\nadaptation of Jos\u00e9 Saramago\u2019s novel _The Double_ scripted by Javier Gull\u00f3n,\nthe surreal film opens with a scene set in a secret club in which women impale\ntarantulas on high heels and only becomes stranger from there. Jake Gyllenhaal\nstars as Adam, a glum Toronto history professor whose life becomes unhinged\nwhen he spots his exact duplicate, Anthony Claire, playing a bellhop in a\nCanadian comedy. After Adam reaches out, his life and Anthony\u2019s (and the lives\nof their partners, played by M\u00e9lanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon) start to overlap\nin uncomfortable ways in what becomes a power struggle. Shot before\n_Prisoners_ but released after, _Enemy_ finds Villeneuve already playing with\nthe conventions of genre filmmaking as he invests even seemingly mundane\nmoments with a sense of dread. What it\u2019s all about remains up for discussion,\nseemingly by design. It\u2019s filled with references to history repeating itself\nand interest in the ways performative masculinity poisons its characters\u2019\nrelationships with women, and leads to an unforgettable final image. But\nVilleneuve feels no obligation to settle on a single theme or reveal _Enemy_\n\u2019s secrets. It\u2019s opaque and inconclusive and all the more haunting for it.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.0415139198303223\nEvery Denis Villeneuve Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\n:\n**However much _Dune_ is an impressive achievement, the top spot in\nVillenevue's filmography could only have been **_**Arrival**_. A science\nfiction film that flaunts convention to tell a story about connection with\nwhat draws us together even amid great strife, it is the best work of not just\nthe director but of cinema broadly in the 21st century. Based on the equally\nmagnificent 1998 short story \"Story of Your Life\" by **Ted Chiang** , it\nfollows linguistics professor Louise Banks as she is called to help\ncommunicate with mysterious life forms that have landed in a spacecraft\nhovering above Montana. Played by the perpetually underrated **Amy Adams** in\none of her best performances to date, Banks will have to find a way to build a\nconnection with not just the aliens but also with her fellow people across the\nworld who are on a razor's edge as they deal with their spacecraft hovering\nabove them. Tensions are high and fear begins to take hold as existing\nconflicts are exacerbated, threatening to send the world into war over what to\ndo with the first contact of this kind. The delicately emotional manner in\nwhich the story grounds itself, looking through time at love and loss, makes\nthis one of the most deeply affecting films of all time. It reveals who we are\nunderneath it all when faced with the unimaginable.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.9026703834533691\nAll 4 Denis Villeneuve Sci-Fi Movies, Ranked\n:\nThere's an argument to be made that Denis Villeneuve's first proper science\nfiction movie, 2016's _**Arrival**_, is his best, and indeed one that's likely\nto be considered an all-time great one within the genre as time goes on. Of\ncourse, its relative recency means it can't quite be declared as great as\nsomething like _**2001: A Space Odyssey**_, but that's a film that has proven\ninfluential over decades and decades, and has clearly not aged much at all.\nIt's too difficult to assess whether _Arrival_ - or any other Denis Villeneuve\nsci-fi movie - can be just as timeless, but the prospects for his movies\nretaining their power for many years to come look good. And, given _Arrival_\nmight be his most succinct, moving, intimate, and haunting work of science\nfiction so far, **it feels somewhat safe to assume it 'll be considered the\ngreatest of his four (so far) in the decades to come**.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.8440905809402466\nThe Best Denis Villeneuve Movies, Ranked\n:\nIn some respects, that makes it a companion piece to _Blade Runner 2049._\nVilleneuve\u2019s follow-up to _Blade Runner_ largely throws out the detective-\nstory framework of the original to explore the wider universe suggested by\nRidley Scott\u2019s 1982 science-fiction classic. The film follows K (Ryan\nGosling), a replicant blade runner who makes a discovery that leads him on a\njourney that will find him questioning the relationship between humanity and\nits android creations \u2014 and, by extension, the nature of existence itself.\nLess a sequel than a companion piece (though Harrison Ford does make a return\nas the original\u2019s hero, Rick Deckard), the film isn\u2019t short on action set\npieces but allows plenty of room for philosophical pondering in the spaces\nbetween them. Another Deakins collaboration, _Blade Runner 2049_ also offers\none stunning image after another \u2014 none more memorable than a ruined Las\nVegas, though some come close. It\u2019s the sort of film where it\u2019s sometimes hard\nto believe what you\u2019re seeing, making it all the more remarkable in an era in\nwhich corner-cutting effects have made images of the extraordinary seem pretty\ndull.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.8437707424163818\nEvery Denis Villeneuve Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\n:\nEven as it all feels like it has been somewhat cheapened by a woefully out-of-\nplace sequel that inexplicably continued without Blunt or Villeneuve, the\noriginal film still offers much to admire. The vast beauty of the visual\nsettings is brilliantly captured even as it masks the ugliness underneath it\nall. Tying this all together is the score of the late **J ohann Johannsson**,\na frequent collaborator of Villeneuve who was lost far too soon. The track\n'Beast' in particular is the frightening yet still outstanding beating heart\nof the film, rattling you to your core as you look upon the nightmares and\nbrutality on display. It leaves you constantly on edge, aware of the ease with\nwhich this world can easily tip into the void of violence at the call of those\nwho operate immense power over it. The people who get unknowingly caught up in\nthis world are merely pawns, collateral damage. The final frames make this\ndynamic clear: leaving you with a profound sense of how tenuous life is for\nthose deemed expendable in an ongoing, bloody power struggle.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.8408949375152588\nThe Best Denis Villeneuve Movies, Ranked\n:\nYet that\u2019s precisely where Villeneuve finds himself after completing a two-\npart adaptation of Frank Herbert\u2019s science-fiction landmark _Dune_ , a project\nonce widely deemed unadaptable after David Lynch\u2019s attempt in 1984. Yet _Dune_\nmight as well have been custom-made for Villeneuve, who designed storyboards\nfor an imagined adaptation with his best friend as a teen. To work, any\nadaptation of Herbert\u2019s book has to capture the violence, moral ambiguity, and\nhuman drama of its far-future world without losing the spectacle or\nhallucinatory weirdness.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.8211450576782227\nEvery Denis Villeneuve Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\n:\nYoung Blade Runner K's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track\ndown former Blade Runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.7798515558242798\nEvery Denis Villeneuve Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\n:\nTo be honest, it surprised even me how high this film ended up being on my\nlist. When it first came out in 2017, _**Blade Runner 2049**_ left me with\nmixed feelings. It was a visually stunning and evocative piece of work, though\nthere were some moments where I found myself losing connection with **Ryan\nGosling** 's K. As the new lead and next generation of Blade Runner tasked\nwith hunting down rogue replicants that attempt to break free of being slave\nlabor, he played the character with such a reserved nature that it was almost\nimpenetrable. On subsequent viewings, it became clear that this was exactly\nthe point. It was the only way he could justify such cruelty and lack of\nempathy for himself.\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",

But it's\nalso a masochistic march through the stations of the cross for Joan Crawford's\nstoic hero as she suffers through a failed first marriage, a playboy second\nhusband, and a spoiled ingrate daughter from hell. Viewed through our 21st-\ncentury lens, Crawford's performance (those shoulder pads!) can seem like it's\nteetering on the edge of camp. After all, it's hard to watch her and not see\nthe long shadow cast by _Mommie Dearest_. But for its time, _Mildred Pierce_'s\nself-made brand of feminism was undeniably revolutionary. Crawford was always\nan underrated actress, but there's something about playing such an\nunderestimated up-by-her-bootstraps woman in Michael Curtiz's film that\nliberates her to be better than she ever was before and better than she ever\nwould be again. _\u2014Chris Nashawaty_\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.7396303415298462\n'Everything Everywhere All At Once' wins best picture at 2023 Oscars\n:\nMichelle Yeoh was among the night\u2019s best-dressed celebrities in a white-\nfeathered Dior gown, while James Hong arrived on the champagne-colored carpet\nwearing one of the night\u2019s boldest accessory: a blue bowtie adorned with \u2014 in\na nod to the film \u2014 a pair of googly eyes.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.7220152616500854\nThe 25 greatest Best Actress winners in Oscar history\n:\nElizabeth Taylor won her second Academy Award blowing up the ing\u00e9nue image\nminted in her Oscar winning-turn in _Butterfield 8_.

What she accomplishes under the direction of Nichols\n(his first film) in this adaptation of Edward Albee's acclaimed play owes much\nto her turbulent relationship with then-husband Burton.

Bergman, then in her late 20s, landed her first Oscar\nfor this intricate, layered, and deeply controlled performance of a bright\nyoung woman unraveling before her own, and our, eyes. Bergman's brilliance\nlies in her ability to project, in just a few early scenes, Paula's\nintelligence and stability, so that her growing terror as she loses her\nability to trust her own mind mirrors our own. In each scene, Bergman makes\nsuch subtle, incremental adjustments to Paula's demeanor that her descent into\n\"madness\" feels, by the climax, both inevitable and, to our horror, utterly\nbelievable. _\u2014Sean Smith_\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.5812305212020874\n'Everything Everywhere All At Once' wins best picture at 2023 Oscars\n:\nJamie Lee Curtis won the award for best actress in a supporting role for her\nperformance in \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d as Deirdre Beaubeirdre.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.505279541015625\n'Everything Everywhere All At Once' wins best picture at 2023 Oscars\n:\n* **That\u2019s a wrap:** \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d dominated the 2023 Oscars.\n                                                * The strange and sentimental film won the big awards, including best picture and directing.

By\nintermission, she knew that she needed to play the lead role of Catherine\nSloper, a lumpy dull charisma-void spinster. Though the role required\nsacrificing vanity, when Catherine's father (Ralph Richardson) destroys her\nchances to marry a gold-digger (Montgomery Clift), the double betrayal\ntransforms the shy woman into an iron maiden. And de Havilland's implosive\nfinal scene, in which she coldly speaks of \"the same lies, the same little\nphrases\" she's heard all her life, could also be viewed as a feminist call to\narms, as well as an indictment of the falseness and cruelty of Hollywood.\n_\u2014Joe McGovern_\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.1566503047943115\n'Everything Everywhere All At Once' wins best picture at 2023 Oscars\n:\nYeoh\u2019s win makes her the first woman of Asian descent and the first Malaysian-\nborn performer to win an Oscar for best actress.

He moved to Paris in 1906 and\nsettled at the Bateau-Lavoir, an artists\u2019 dwelling where his compatriot Pablo\nPicasso lived. Gris was thus in touch with the evolution of Cubism, a style\ninitiated by Picasso and Georges Braque around 1907. Gris executed his first\nserious paintings in 1910 and adopted the Cubist style the following year. In\n1912 the prominent art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler agreed to purchase his\nentire artistic output.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.76080584526062\nJuan Gris Paintings, Bio, Ideas | TheArtStory\n:\nThough many recognized his talent in its own right, his work followed the\naustere monochromatic style of Analytic Cubism in the early 1910s, and moved\nin the direction of Synthetic Cubism \\- a subsequent phase, distinguished by a\nbroader, bolder use of color and a collage-like approach to composition - from\n1914 onward. Departing from Picasso and Braque somewhat, his work from the\nlatter period is distinguished by its move away from shattering abstraction\nand use of bright, harmonious colors in daring combinations.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 2.3404836654663086\nJuan Gris | Cubist, Still Life, Collage | Britannica\n:\nIn 1912 Picasso and Braque abandoned their abstract analyses of form and began\nto synthesize images from found shapes and textures, a style that is referred\nto as Synthetic Cubism. The following year Gris arrived at his own personal\nand mature version of Synthetic Cubism. His works are characterized by\nrigorously geometric compositions in which fragmented objects and sharp-edged\nplanes are articulated with maximum clarity. A more theoretical painter than\nPicasso or Braque, Gris systematized their discoveries, making their\nintuitions comprehensible and, consequently, helping to spread the Cubist\nstyle. His version of Cubism was more severe and classical, and less\nspontaneous, than theirs. Between 1921 and 1927, however, Gris transformed his\nSynthetic Cubist idiom so that his style became increasingly free and lyrical.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.916784405708313\nJuan Gris | Cubist, Still Life, Collage | Britannica\n:\n**Juan Gris** , (born March 23, 1887, Madrid, Spain\u2014died May 11, 1927,\nBoulogne-sur-Seine, France), Spanish painter whose lucidly composed still\nlifes are major works of the style called Synthetic Cubism.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.475771188735962\nStill Life Paintings by Juan Gris\n:\nCubism was the first abstract art form and the most revolutionary art movement\nof the 20th century. It was originally conceived and developed in France by\nPablo Picasso and Georges Braque around 1907, but other artists soon adopted\nthe style. The Spanish artist Juan Gris (his real name was Jos\u00e9 Victoriano\nGonz\u00e1lez-P\u00e9rez), a friend and neighbour of Picasso in Paris, was the best of\nthese and he refined the cubist vocabulary into his own instantly recognizable\nvisual language. He is often referred to as 'the third cubist'.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.3714474439620972\nThe Visual Games of Juan Gris | Close Look | The Metropolitan Museum ...\n:\nBeginning in 1912, Cubism was emerging as the era's most compelling artistic\nstyle, radically reimagining the possibilities of pictorial space. Three of\nthe movement's leading artists--Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Juan Gris--\nbegan to incorporate items such as newspaper, wallpaper, and other\ncommercially printed and found objects into their Cubist works.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.3023245334625244\nJuan Gris - 205 artworks - painting\n:\nJuan Gris is recognized along with Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Fernand\nLeger as one of the four major figures in Cubism, the avant-garde 20th-century\nart movement that revolutionized European painting and sculpture. Gris was\nborn in 1887 in Madrid, where he later studied engineering from 1902 to 1904.\nGradually, he started to shift his attention to drawing and began creating\nillustrations for local periodicals. In 1906, Gris moved to Paris, to the\nMontmartre neighborhood, where he met Pablo Picasso, who introduced him to the\nleading avant-garde artists, poets, and critics of the time: George Braque,\nGuillaume Apollinaire, Gertrude Stein, Max Jacob, and Pierre Reverdy. Gris\nworked as a graphic artist, creating drawings for political and satirical\nmagazines. Influenced by his environment, he started to pursue painting\nseriously in 1911. He made his artistic debut in the 1912 Salon of Independent\nArtists with _The Portrait of Pablo Picasso_ (1912), a painting that is\nconsidered one of the finest examples of Cubist portraiture.  \n  \nIn 1913, under the influence of Picasso and Braque, Gris began to experiment\nwith collage and, more specifically, _papier coll e_ (cut and pasted paper).\nThrough these artistic experiments, Gris contributed to the development of\nSynthetic Cubism \u2013 a later phase of Cubism that emphasized the flat quality of\nthe image. Gris\u2019s style was characterized by the structured geometric\ncompositions that presented fragmented objects and overlapping planes. This\nstyle was encompassed in paintings like _Still Life before an Open Window,\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.2147905826568604\nJuan Gris | Cubist, Still Life, Collage | Britannica\n:\nMarch 23, 1887, Madrid, Spain\n_(Show  more)_\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 1.1385247707366943\nJuan Gris - 205 artworks - painting\n:\nJose Victoriano (Carmelo Carlos) Gonzalez-Perez (March 23, 1887 \u2013 May 11,\n1927), better known as Juan Gris (Spanish: [\u02c8xwan \u02c8\u0261\u027eis]; French: [g\u0280i]), was\na Spanish painter and sculptor born in Madrid who lived and worked in France\nmost of his life. Closely connected to the innovative artistic genre Cubism,\nhis works are among the movement's most distinctive.  \n  \nGris was born in Madrid. He later studied engineering at Madrid's School of\nArts and Sciences. There, from 1902 to 1904, he contributed drawings to local\nperiodicals. From 1904 to 1905, he studied painting with the academic artist\nJose Moreno Carbonero. It was in 1905 that Jose Victoriano Gonzalez adopted\nthe more distinctive name Juan Gris.  \n  \nIn 1906 he moved to Paris and became friends with Henri Matisse, Georges\nBraque and Fernand Leger. In Paris, Gris followed the lead of another friend\nand fellow countryman, Pablo Picasso. He submitted darkly humorous\nillustrations to journals such as the anarchist satirical magazine L'Assiette\nau Beurre, and also Le Rire, Le Charivari, and Le Cri de Paris.  \n  \nGris began to paint seriously in 1910 (when he gave up working as a satirical\ncartoonist), developing at this time a personal Cubist style. In A Life of\nPicasso, John Richardson writes that Jean Metzinger's 1911 work, Le gouter\n(Tea Time), persuaded Juan Gris of the importance of mathematics in painting.\nGris exhibited for the first time at the 1912 Salon des Independants (a\npainting entitled Hommage a Pablo Picasso).  \n  \n\"He appears with two styles\", writes art historian Peter Brooke, \"In one of\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.9674676656723022\nJuan Gris Paintings, Bio, Ideas | TheArtStory\n:\nMajor exhibitions of his work took place at the Galerie Simon in Paris and the\nGalerie Flechtheim in Berlin in 1923, and at the Galerie Flechtheim in\nD\u00fcsseldorf in 1925. It was during these years that he achieved the peak of\npopularity and renown that he would know in his lifetime. He was also making\nhis most forceful articulation of his theories on art and aesthetics,\ndelivering his lecture, 'Des possibilites de la peinture' at the Sorbonne in\n1924. In it, he describes his belief that a painting was not merely a\nrepresentation of an object from reality, but something that the artist\nrecreates and reinterprets through his craft.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.9145685434341431\nJuan Gris Paintings, Bio, Ideas | TheArtStory\n:\nThe man who would become Juan Gris, one of the leading figures in Cubist\npainting, was born Jos\u00e9 Victoriano Carmelo Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez-P\u00e9rez in Madrid in\n1887. The thirteenth of fourteen children, he attended Madrid's Escuela de\nArtes y Manufacturas from 1902 to 1904, where he studied mathematics, physics,\nand mechanical drawing. Though he was a strong student, the rigidity of\nacademic life did not appeal to him, and his natural ability in drawing\nencouraged him to shift his focus to the study of art.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.892784595489502\nThe Visual Games of Juan Gris | Close Look | The Metropolitan Museum ...\n:\nIn 1914, Gris made a series of dynamic and intriguing still-life compositions\nthat display his mastery of the form. A virtuoso at manipulating materials,\nGris made formally and technically complex works by layering his carefully\nselected papers--piecing together intersecting shapes, textures, patterns, and\ncolors--and using paints, pencils, and crayons to play sophisticated visual\ngames.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.8248696327209473\nJuan Gris Paintings, Bio, Ideas | TheArtStory\n:\nA return to traditional values, subjects, and forms is reflected in Gris's\nwork after 1918, and is typical of avant-garde painting in general in the\nyears after World War I. From summer through fall of 1918, he temporarily\nrelocated to Touraine, the countryside region where his wife, Josette, had\ngrown up, and painted peasants in the traditional clothing of the region.\nRather than a specific individual, the old peasant in this scene is an\narchetypal resident of the area. More somber in tone than many of his\npreceding works in the Synthetic Cubist mode, and simpler, limited to a figure\nand some objects arranged in two distinct planes, his representation of a\nfarmer expresses a nostalgic mood and a yearning for an enduring, traditional\nway of life in a chaotic and uncertain time.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.7171887755393982\nJuan Gris Paintings, Bio, Ideas | TheArtStory\n:\nThough he experienced periods of illness and financial strife during the war\nyears, his reputation was steadily rising. He was awarded his first major solo\nexhibition at Rosenberg's Galerie l'Effort Moderne in Paris in 1919. The\nfollowing year, he participated in the final major exhibition of Cubist\npainters at the Salon des Independants.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.7058547139167786\nJuan Gris Paintings, Bio, Ideas | TheArtStory\n:\n1912\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.545400083065033\nThe Visual Games of Juan Gris | Close Look | The Metropolitan Museum ...\n:\n_The Musician's Table _(1914) offers a clear demonstration of these techniques\nand how, with great precision and attention to detail, Gris created complex\npuzzles of textures and patterns.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.5097895264625549\nJuan Gris Paintings, Bio, Ideas | TheArtStory\n:\n1927\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.4761957824230194\nJuan Gris Paintings, Bio, Ideas | TheArtStory\n:\nBorn: March 23 1887 - Madrid, Spain\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.46890780329704285\nJuan Gris Paintings, Bio, Ideas | TheArtStory\n:\n1914\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 0.3351113498210907\nJuan Gris Paintings, Bio, Ideas | TheArtStory\n:\n1915\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",

The causes of  the Great Depression were many and varied,\nbut the impact was visible across the country. By the time that FDR was\ninaugurated president on March 4, 1933, the banking system had collapsed,\nnearly 25% of the labor force was unemployed, and prices and productivity had\nfallen to 1/3 of their 1929 levels. Reduced prices and reduced output resulted\nin lower incomes in wages, rents, dividends, and profits throughout the\neconomy. Factories were shut down, farms and homes were lost to foreclosure,\nmills and mines were abandoned, and people went hungry. The resulting lower\nincomes meant the further inability of the people to spend or to save their\nway out of the crisis, thus perpetuating the economic slowdown in a seemingly\nnever-ending cycle.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 8.28085994720459\nGreat Depression | Definition, History, Dates, Causes, Effects, ...\n:\nThe Great Depression, which began in the United States in 1929 and spread\nworldwide, was the longest and most severe economic downturn in modern\nhistory.

It was the longest and most severe depression ever\nexperienced by the industrialized Western world, sparking fundamental changes\nin economic institutions, macroeconomic policy, and economic theory. Although\nit originated in the United States, the Great Depression caused drastic\ndeclines in output, severe unemployment, and acute deflation in almost every\ncountry of the world.

The downturn became markedly worse, however, in late 1929\nand continued until early 1933. Real output and prices fell precipitously.\nBetween the peak and the trough of the downturn, industrial production in the\nUnited States declined 47 percent and real gross domestic product (GDP) fell\n30 percent. The wholesale price index declined 33 percent (such declines in\nthe price level are referred to as deflation). Although there is some debate\nabout the reliability of the statistics, it is widely agreed that the\nunemployment rate exceeded 20 percent at its highest point.

However, the stock market collapse did not cause\nthe depression; nor can it explain the extraordinary length and depth of the\nAmerican contraction. In most countries, such as Britain, France, Canada, the\nNetherlands, and the Nordic countries, the depression was less severe and\nshorter, often ending by 1931. Those countries did not have the banking and\nfinancial crises that the United States did, and most left the gold standard\nearlier than the United States did. In the United States, in contrast, the\ncontraction continued for four years from the summer of 1929 through the first\nquarter of 1933. During that time real GNP fell 30.5 percent, wholesale prices\nfell 30.8 percent, and consumer prices fell 24.4 percent.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.821839809417725\nMilestones: 1921\u20131936 - Office of the Historian\n:\nThe origins of the Great Depression were complicated and have been much\ndebated among scholars. The initial factor was the First World War, which\nupset international balances of power and caused a dramatic shock to the\nglobal financial system. The gold standard, which had long served as the basis\nfor national currencies and their exchange rates, had to be temporarily\nsuspended in order to recover from the costs of the Great War, but the United\nStates, European nations, and Japan put forth great effort to reestablish it\nby the end of the decade. However, this introduced inflexibility into domestic\nand international financial markets, which meant that they were less able to\ndeal with additional shocks when they came in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\nThe U.S. stock market crash of 1929, an economic downturn in Germany, and\nfinancial difficulties in France and Great Britain all coincided to cause a\nglobal financial crisis. Dedication to the gold standard in each of these\nnations and Japan, which only managed to return to it in 1930, only made the\nproblem worse and hastened the slide into what is now known as the Great\nDepression.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 6.765078544616699\nGreat Depression Facts - FDR Presidential Library & Museum\n:\nAt the height of the Depression in 1933, 24.9% of the nation's total work\nforce, 12,830,000 people, were unemployed.

This deeply\nmoving song is another of Radiohead\u2019s knockout album closers, and its vision\nof a dying farewell through videotape is a nifty corollary to \u201cA Reminder\u201d and\nits idea of a song to play someone over the phone anytime they need it. \u201cNo\nmatter what happens now,\u201d Yorke promises, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.3176469802856445\nThe Best Radiohead Songs: All 158 Tracks, Ranked\n:\n**26\\. \u201cGive Up the Ghost,\u201d _The King of Limbs_**  \n_The King of Limbs_ may feel like a quirky detour after the release of _A Moon\nShaped Pool_ , which more clearly connects Radiohead to its millennial\nheights, but don\u2019t overlook this quiet stunner, with acoustic strums and\nelectronic undertow. \u201cDon\u2019t haunt me,\u201d Yorke softly pleads. Too late.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.3132143020629883\nRadiohead | Rock Music Wiki | Fandom\n:\nRadiohead released a number of singles from  _In Rainbows_ in support of the\nalbum; \"Jigsaw Falling into Place\", the first, was released in the UK in\nJanuary 2008. The second single, \"Nude\", debuted at number 37 in the\n_Billboard_ Hot 100, Radiohead's first song to make that chart since 1995's\n\"High and Dry\" and their first top 40 hit in the US since \"Creep\". Radiohead\ncontinued to put out tracks from  _In Rainbows_ as singles and videos; in July\na digitally shot video for \"House of Cards\" was made available.\"House of\nCards\", along with \"Bodysnatchers\", also received a single release on radio.\nIn September the band announced a fourth single, \"Reckoner\", and a remix\ncompetition similar to one organised for \"Nude\". A greatest hits album, titled\n_Radiohead: The Best Of_ , was released by EMI in June 2008. The compilation\nwas made without the input of the band and also did not contain any songs from\n_In Rainbows_ , as the band had already left their label. Yorke expressed his\ndisapproval on behalf of Radiohead: \"We haven't really had any hits so what\nexactly is the purpose? ... It's a wasted opportunity in that if we'd been\nbehind it, and we wanted to do it, then it might have been good.\" From\nmid-2008 to early 2009, Radiohead toured North America, Europe, Japan, Mexico\nand South America to promote  _In Rainbows_. The band headlined the Reading\nand Leeds Festivals in August 2009.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.2645978927612305\nThe Best Radiohead Songs: All 158 Tracks, Ranked\n:\nThe trailblazing U.K. quintet\u2019s more recent activity has been just as\nfascinating: Their ninth studio album, _A Moon Shaped Pool_ _,_ was released\nin 2016. In the years before that, Yorke has brooded as a glitchy electronic\nsolo artist when not shaking his ponytail as a member of the rhythm-centered\nAtoms for Peace supergroup; multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood has roamed\nfrom scoring Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s film _Inherent Vice_ to recording with\ntraditional musicians in India; and drummer Phil Selway has devised his own\nsinger/songwriter miniatures. But on _A Moon Shaped Pool_ , that sense of the\nhalf-understood sublime, conveyed most powerfully through Yorke\u2019s fragile\nupper register and foreboding keys, remained undimmed. Radiohead\u2019s still doing\nit.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.2147886753082275\nThe Best Radiohead Songs: All 158 Tracks, Ranked\n:\n**158\\. \u201cPop Is Dead,\u201d _Pablo Honey_(Collector\u2019s Edition)**  \nThom Yorke said he wrote this 1993 non-album single \u2014 the band\u2019s third, issued\nbefore the re-release and eventual climb of \u201cCreep\u201d \u2014 \u201cas a kind of epitaph to\n1992.\u201d That\u2019s probably a fine place to leave it.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.151564598083496\nRadiohead | Rock Music Wiki | Fandom\n:\nRadiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, with the band's\nwork being placed highly in both listener polls and critics' lists, they have\nthe distinction of doing so in both the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, Radiohead\nwere ranked number 73 in  _Rolling Stone'_s list of \"The Greatest Artists of\nAll Time\", while Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien were both included in\n_Rolling Stone's_ list of greatest guitarists, and Thom Yorke in their list of\ngreatest singers. In 2009,  _Rolling Stone_ readers voted the group the second\nbest artist of the 2000s.\n</DOC>\n\n<DOC> 3.0576910972595215\nThe Best Radiohead Songs: All 158 Tracks, Ranked\n:\n**108\\. \u201cUp on the Ladder,\u201d _In Rainbows [CD2]_**  \nEvidently dating back to the _Kid A_ /  _Amnesiac_ sessions, and performed\nlive in 2002, \u201cUp on the Ladder\u201d eventually saw release on the bonus disc\nwithin the _In Rainbows_ box set.

He cited \"Nude\", written\nin the 1990s but released in 2007, as an example of a song that took years\nto complete.\n</DOC>\n</DOCS>",
