Microsoft Office 2019 - Wikipedia
Microsoft Office 2019 (second release codenamed Office 16) is a version of
Microsoft Office for both Windows and Mac. It replaces Office 2016 and was
replaced by Office 2021 on October 5, 2021.[8] It was unveiled on April 27,
2018, for Windows 10 and June 12, 2018, for macOS, and launched on September
24, 2018.[1] Some features that had previously been restricted to Office 365
subscribers are available in this release.[9] Office 2019 retains the same
major version number of 16 that Office 2016 had, making it the second
perpetual release of Office 16. Microsoft ended mainstream support for Office
2019 on October 10, 2023. Unlike other versions of Microsoft Office, Office
2019 will only get two years of extended support, which means that support for
Office 2019 will end on the same day as support for Office 2016 and Windows
10, on October 14, 2025.[10]

For Office 2013 and 2016, various editions containing the client apps were
available in both Click-To-Run (inspired by Microsoft App-V) and traditional
Windows Installer setup formats. However, Office 2019 client apps only have a
Click-to-Run installer and only the server apps have the traditional MSI
installer. The Click-To-Run version has a smaller footprint; in case of
Microsoft Office 2019 Pro Plus, the product requires 10 GB less than the MSI
version of Office 2016 Pro Plus.[22]

Heaven vs Hell - Difference and Comparison | Diffen
#### Hell
Muslims believe in jahannam (in Arabic: جهنم) (which comes from the Hebrew
word gehennim and resembles the versions of Hell in Christianity). In the
Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, there are literal descriptions of the
condemned in a fiery Hell, as contrasted to the garden-like Paradise (jannah)
enjoyed by righteous believers. In addition, Heaven and Hell are split into
many different levels depending on the actions perpetrated in life, where
punishment is given depending on the level of evil done in life, and good is
separated into other levels depending on how well one followed God while
alive. There is an equal number of mentions of both Hell and paradise in the
Qur'an, which is considered by believers to be among the numeric miracles in
the Qur'an.[citation needed] The Islamic concept of Hell is similar to the
medieval Christian view of Dante. [citation needed] However, Satan is not
viewed as Hell's ruler, merely one of its sufferers. The gate of Hell is
guarded by Maalik also known as Zabaaniyah. The Quran states that the fuel of
Hellfire is rocks/stones (idols) and human beings. Names of Hell according to
Islamic Tradition based on the Quranic ayah and Hadith:

Heaven and Hell | Cru
As the template of continuity/discontinuity can keep us from
overspiritualizing heaven, so we also want to be aware that Scripture uses
symbolic language to describe the new heavens and new earth – language meant
to convey concepts, not actual geography. Symbolism is shorthand for reality.
When you see a symbol for a women’s room, you know what it means, but women

Heaven vs Hell - Difference and Comparison | Diffen
#### Hell
In Christianity, the popularly used word Hell, however, is a translation of
three Greek words: hades, Gehenna, and Tartarus. Hades, literally meaning
unseen, usually refers to the state of death, which is defined by some as a
conscious waiting place for resurrection, and by others as a state of
unconsciousness synonymous with death itself. Gehenna, on the other hand, more
ambiguous than hades, seems to refer to judgment and fits more closely with
the modern conceptions of Hell. Tartarus is used in reference to the judgment
of sinning angels and seems to be an allusion to Greek mythology (see
Tartarus). While the majority of Christianity views Hell as a place of eternal
torment, some Christians, such as Universalist Christians (see Universalism)
contend that after resurrection, unrepentant sinners are judged and purified
in the lake of fire and then later accepted into Heaven, while others believe
that after resurrection, the unrepentant sinners are permanently destroyed in
the lake of fire (see annihilationism). Various interpretations of the
torments of Hell exist, ranging from fiery pits of wailing sinners to lonely
isolation from God's presence. However, the descriptions of Hell found in the
Bible are quite vague. The books of Matthew, Mark, and Jude tell of a place of
fire, while the books of Luke and Revelation report it as an abyss. Our
modern, more graphic, images of Hell have developed from writings that are not
found in the Bible. Dante's The Divine Comedy is a classic inspiration for
modern images of Hell. Other early Christian writings also illustrate the
anguish of Hell. Most Christians believe that damnation occurs immediately
upon death (particular judgment), and others that it occurs after Judgment
Day, which is written about in the book of Revelation.

## Definition
### Heaven
Originally the term "heaven" referred to the sky or the area above the earth
where the "heavenly bodies" are placed. This is the main meaning of the word
in the Bible. It was considered the dwelling place of God and his angels.
However, with time, the term came to be used also in the sense of the abode of
the righteous at some point after death. This is supported by a few verses in
the Bible, but the Bible tends to use other terms, such as Paradise, for this.

You are a helpful, respectful and honest question answering system. I will be providing you with questions, as well as some additional context that may be helpful in answering those questions. You will be provided with additional information between the "<DOCS>" tags. Keep your answers brief, ideally less than 20 words, but a strict limit of 30 words.

If the provided information is insufficient for answering the question, simply output "Insuffient information" and only output that. If the question asserts a false premise, like "When did Eisenhower become Prime Minister?", simply output "Invalid question". Thus, if you are inclined to say something like "X never has" or "X never was" or "X never did", your output should be "Invalid question".

Final reminder, with award shows, years can be tricky. Often awards are handed out the year after the project is made. Thus for the Oscars in 2015, the awards are being given out to movies made in 2014.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Universal itself was the film (outside of America) and video distributor for
DreamWorks live-action titles and DWA titles (Back when DreamWorks Animation
was a division of DW before it was spun off in 2004), DreamWorks' theatrical
films from 1998-2006 in American however were distributed by Universal, but
through their then DreamWorks Pictures label. DreamWorks was then sold to
Paramount Pictures in 2006, at which point Paramount took over distribution.

DreamWorks' animation arm was spun off in 2004 into DreamWorks Animation SKG
(DWA), which currently owns the DreamWorks trademarks, and as of August 2016
is a subsidiary of NBCUniversal.[6] Spielberg's company continues to use the
DreamWorks trademarks under license from Universal Studios.[7][8]

In August 2016, NBCUniversal, whose subsidiary Universal Pictures entered a
distribution deal with the live-action DreamWorks studio via Amblin Partners
in December 2015, acquired DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion.[63][6]
DreamWorks Animation's distribution contract with 20th Century Fox will
conclude in 2019, after which Universal is expected to handle future releases,
starting with How to Train Your Dragon 3 .[64][65]

Universal Pictures | Dreamworks Animation Wiki | Fandom
After Viacom spun off DreamWorks Studios in 2008, Universal was planned to
resume distributing DreamWorks' movies, but this deal fell through as Disney
took over the distribution for DreamWorks movies under the Touchstone Pictures
banner starting in 2011 until 2016. In April 2016, Comcast (which owns
Universal) purchased DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 Billion. It is therefore
likely that when the current distribution deal with 20th Century Fox finishes,
DreamWorks Animation's films will be distributed by Universal. How to Train
Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2019) was the first DWA film distributed by
Universal and as a Universal subsidiary.
