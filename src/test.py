1995 Academy Award Nominees: Best Documentary Feature:
COMPLAINTS OF A DUTIFUL DAUGHTER Producer, Director, and Writer: Deborah Hoffmann Cinematography: Frances Reid Editors: Jennifer Chinlund and Deborah Hoffmann Music: Mary Watkins Distributor: Women Make Movies With profound insight and a healthy dose of visual and verbal levity, the personal documentary Complaints of a Dutiful Daughter chronicles the progressive stages of a mother's Alzheimer's disease and the evolving response of the daughter—who is also the filmmaker—to the illness. The desire to cure the incurable—to set right her mother's confusion and forgetfulness, to temper her mother's obsessiveness gives way to an acceptance that is finally liberating for both daughter and mother. Deborah Hoffmann (Producer/Director/Writer) has worked in the San Francisco Bay Area as a film and video editor for the past 12 years, editing numerous internationally acclaimed documentaries. Hoffmann's editing on The Times of Harvey Milk earned her a national Emmy, and the film received an Academy Award. Marlon Riggs's Color Adjustment , which she edited, received a Peabody and an IDA Distinguished Documentary Achievement Award. She also edited Ethnic Notions and Men Who Molest , both of which received national Emmys; was an editor on Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt , which received an Academy Award; and edited Acting Our Age , about women growing old.

Charles Guggenheim (Producer/Director), a Washington, D.C., based filmmaker, has achieved an international reputation in the area of documentary films. His nonfiction films for television and theatrical release have covered architecture, history, and social issues. Described by the Saturday Review's film critic, Hollis Alpert, as "probably the most accomplished maker of documentary films in the country," Guggenheim has won top awards in every major international film competition. He has received the George Foster Peabody Award in broadcasting, eight Academy Award nominations, and three Academy Awards.

For decades, Jean Bach (Producer) has been part of the jazz scene A Great Day in Harlem brings to life.
