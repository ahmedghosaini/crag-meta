# ### EXAMPLE ONLY
# QUESTION: how much further can bald eagles see than humans?
# <DOCS>
# <DOC> They have amazing eyesight: A human with perfect eyesight has 20/20 vision. Bald eagles can have 20/4 or 20/5 vision, meaning they can see four or five times farther than the average person.</DOC>
# <DOC> There are many metrics to compare. For example, Human eyes take up only 5% of our head, eagle eyes occupy 50%. The back of their eyes is bigger and flatter, physically allowing for a bigger picture on their retinas, which are more densely covered in light detector cells (cones). Eagles see clearly for up to 5x further than a human with perfect vision.</DOC>
# </DOCS>
# ANSWER: Up to 4 to 5 times as far as an average human.

# QUESTION: which state was joe biden born?
# <DOCS>
# <DOC> Early life: Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942, at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Catherine Eugenia "Jean" Biden (n√©e Finnegan) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr. The oldest child in a Catholic family of English, French, and Irish descent, he has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Francis and James.</DOC>
